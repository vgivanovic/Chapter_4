*** Latino ELL students do worse than ELL students in public schools even though RS claims to be closing the achievement gap
*** if you will
*** concision is important
*** check on CA's non-classroom based instruction moratorium expiring soon

*** Work hard, be hard
Little work on
answer with data that can be replicated
*** systematic study
-  RQ: different factors influence relate to RS's
how do  cmo structure, bl pedagogy, location 
  affect RS's finances
  what is the role?

  examine various factors aspects profits from tax dollars

- what are the ways that non-profit charter school chains derive profits from public funds
- Does RS only invest in locations where LCFF funding gives unduplicated pupils extra $$$
- sacklers invest in charter schools
  - highlight benefits
  - downplay difficulties
  - Sackler – Rocketship???

*** Comparisons
\section{How Does Rocketship Compare?}\label{sec:comparisons}
\subsection{Demographic Data}
When searching for anomalous data, Rocketship schools, individually and collectively, need to be compared to traditional public schools and districts, but only after making any needed adjustments to account for the demographic contexts in which the schools operate. It makes no sense to compare the finances of, say, Rocketship Mateo Sheedy in San José with the finances of the Westside Union Elementary School in Los Baños, less than 65 miles away. One is a medium-sized charter school in a large urban school district, the other is a much larger public school in a rural public district. This means that demographic data must be used along with financial data to obtain valid and useful comparisons.

Raw demographic data is hard to use and impossible to visualize. In 1983, Edward Tufte self-published \citetitle{Tufte1983}, which revolutionized how we present data, especially quantitative data. Since then, not only have there been five other Tufte books, but there has been an explosion of high quality books on data visualization. Currently, the most useful guide to presenting data is \citeauthor{Schwabish2021}'s \citetitle{Schwabish2021}.  In it he offers more than 50 different kinds of charts and graphs, all with the goal of helping the reader make sense of the raw data. The chapters \textit{\titleref{ch:results}} and \textit{\titleref{ch:discussion}} will make extensive use of these data visualization tools. The data demographic data itself will come from the following datasets that specialize in education:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Data from the United States Department of Education, primarily the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). These datasets (~500) are searchable online using the Open Data Platform \url{http://nces.ed.gov/}. Of particular interest is the massive Digest of Education Statistics, produced annually from 1990 onwards. The Digest for 2019 runs to 651 pages.
  \item The NCES Open Data Platform can analyze over 15,000 data sets in its collection.
  \item The Institute of Education Sciences, which is part of the NCES, maintains DataLab, a tool to analyze a very large number datasets, some of which span years, thus enabling longitudional studies to be undertaken
  \item The Stanford Educational Data Archive (SEDA) is a carefully cleaned and curated dataset that includes

  \begin{quotation}\noindent\OnehalfSpacing%
    \ldots~a range of detailed data on educational conditions, contexts, and outcomes in schools and school districts across the United States. It includes data at a range of institutional and geographic levels of aggregation, including schools, districts, counties, commuting zones, metropolitan areas, and states. It includes measures of academic achievement, achievement gaps, school and neighborhood racial and socioeconomic composition, school and neighborhood racial and socioeconomic segregation patterns, and other features of the schooling system. \sourceatright{\parencite{Reardon.etal2021}}
  \end{quotation}
  
  \item The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), both the current results and the long-term trend results.
  \item The Early Childhood Longitudinal Studies (ECLS), kindergarten cohorts of 1998 \& 2011.
\end{itemize}

*** Comparisons
A comparison of Rocketship schools with public schools will require more than just financial statements. For example, answering a question like, ``Do Rocketship schools have higher administrative costs compared to nearby public schools?'' requires not only financial data, but also knowledge of student demographics to ensure that a like comparison is being made. For example, one district may send its special needs children to an adjacent district that is known to serve special needs children particularly well. The sending district will spend less on administrators and the receiving district more, skewing a straight up comparison.
*** Themes
Several themes run through this study. The first is Rocketship's relationship to the privatization movement in education. The second is how Rocketship's finances drive its need to expand. The third is how Rocketship needs continued marketing and public relations to survive.
*** Rent & sale price
because the sale price of commercial property is mostly the present value of an income stream (the gross rent) whereas the cost is the present value of the stream of net rent. I.e. the charter needs to borrow (or forgo investing) the net rent, and the interest paid or foregone represent the cost of borrowing the net rent. Since the net rent is much lower than the market rate, the owner makes a tidy profit. In addition, the risk associated with the purchase is significantly lower than usual.
*** Dreambox
For example, Rocketship bought from Dreambox the software it uses in blended learning. Creating software for blended learning is not hard. In fact, there are a half-dozen or more free, open-source learning platforms that can be re-skinned (i.e. given a new look-and-feel). Some of these platforms have been around for decades and are therefore quite robust. They are also extensible, either with plugins or via an API, and at worst, the source code itself can be modified. So, the per-pupil cost of blended learning software should be low compared to bespoke software. If this is not the case, then Rocketship would be overpaying and the amount of overpayment is profit which accrues to the software vendor, not Rocketship.

*** Discussion

\subsection{Construct Validity}
\textit{Construct validity} is the extent to which a case study's choice of what to measure actually measure what it claims to measure. Our intent is to measure how much profit Rocketship produces. If we choose to use the financial statements of Rocketship Education and associated entities, will they provide a comprehensive enough of a picture of Rocketship's finances to measure how much profit Rocketship generates? Here we are actually asking two questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Are the financial statements which exist trustworthy?
  \item Do financial statements provide a complete view into Rocketship's finances?
\end{enumerate}

An answer to the first question can be provided by remembering Enron and noting that it fooled all of the people for quite some time. For charter schools, we note that there is a constant stream of charter school fraud that's being uncovered, despite requirements for annual audits. Even worse, in some cases, there is a complete absence of financial statements because many charter school chains are operated by and perhaps owned by a private entity. As private entities, these charter school operators are entitled to keep their finances secret. So, unfortunately, the answer to the first question must be, no, the financial statements which do exist, if they exist, are not necessarily trustworthy. We can use triangulation to fill in gaps and to cross-reference. It is very hard to cover all of one's tracks.

One is tempted to infer that whenever a private, for-profit charter school chain refuses to open its books to public inspection, there is likely something of material significance it wishes to hide. This, however many times it proves to be correct, is still an unwarranted generalization.

The answer to the second question above is: perhaps. If one assumes that there are annual, certified audits, then at least part of a charter school's finances are visible and add up. But, what's not accounted for are transactions that are not arm's length, i.e.~they are self-dealing. Yes, the books are available for inspection, and they balance, but the probity of the transactions is questionable at best and fraudulent at worst.

In the end, we are left with some doubt and suspicion, even if everything adds up. We do find unexplained anomalies, books which don't balance, or money which has simply disappeared and no explanation is forthcoming, we can be confident that we have uncovered something illegal.

\subsection{Internal Validity}
\textit{Internal validity} concerns the completeness and appropriateness of any proposed cause for a set of phenomena. \citeauthor{Yin2018} says,
\begin{quotation}\noindent\OnehalfSpacing%
  [T]he concern over internal validity, for case study research, extends to the broader problem of making inferences. Basically, a case study involves an inference every time an event cannot be directly observed. An investigator will “infer” that a particular event resulted from some earlier occurrence, based on interview and documentary evidence collected as part of the case study. Is the inference correct? Have all the rival explanations and possibilities been considered? Is the evidence convergent? Does the evidence appear to be airtight? \parencite{Yin2018}
\end{quotation}

This dissertation depends the internal validity of documentary evidence, namely, Rocketship's financial statements. These are declared to be true and accurate, to the best of the preparer's knowledge, under penalty of perjury, a strong but not absolute guarantee of their truthfulness and accuracy.

\subsection{External Validity}
\textit{External validity} is the extent to which a study's finding can be applied to other events or situations. Can the explanations given be applied to other charter school chains? If the purpose of this study is to change public policy to better serve kids, then the phenomena examined, described, and explored should be useful in more than just Rocketship's case.

\subsection{Reliability}
A case study is said to be \textit{reliable} when similar findings obtain from similar data. Would another researcher come to the same conclusions when presented with Rocketship's financial data? If the answer is yes, then the case study may be said to be reliable.

\subsection{Rival Explanations}
\textit{Rival explanations} are alternative ways of looking at the data and drawing alternative conclusions. The following sections look at Rocketship from the point of view of political economy, <stuff>.

\subsubsection{\textit{The Political Economy of Public Policy}}
\citefirstlastauthor{BuenoDeMesquita2016} in \citetitle{BuenoDeMesquita2016} proposes that we should evaluate public policy issues using \textit{models} which are then themselves evaluated using different \textit{normative} lenses. \textcite[13–47]{BuenoDeMesquita2016} offers three normative frameworks for us to consider:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]\OnehalfSpacing%
  \item \textbf{Utilitarianism} A public policy is right or wrong, good or bad, valuable or not based on the policy's consequences. Right and wrong, good and bad, valuable and not valuable are collapsed into the notion of \textit{utility}. Policies with greater aggregate utility should be pursued; those with less utility should not.
  \item \textbf{Egalitarianism} Public policy should be evaluated using the notion of \textit{equality}. One might consider equality of \textit{outcomes} or of \textit{opportunity}.
  \item \textbf{Kantian Deontology} The worth of a policy is to be judged by its conformance to some moral norm or duty. These norms are frequently expressed as \textit{rights}, which, in turn, imply a \textit{duty} to others to honor those rights.
\end{itemize}

These three normative lenses allow us to evaluate Rocketship's worth. Does it increase society's utility? And, does it do so without making others worse off (a \textit{Pareto improvement}). Does it create equality of outcomes or of opportunity? Finally, does it honor some rights that people claim they have?

\section{Limitations}
It is always fair to ask what the limitations of a study or research are, and how valid are its conclusions. High quality studies make an effort to address legitimate objections that might be raised. In addition, social science studies often have policy implications: ``How should public policy change to advance the common good in light of the study's finding?''

Unfortunately, in general, there are more ways that a study could be limited than there are ways of producing a robust study. A single omission or error can doom a study, but to be valuable and to be able to withstand objections, a study has to get everything right. These issues are not as acute for case studies, like this dissertation, because no data amenable to statistical analysis is being collected or analyzed. Instead, the question is, ``Has the study captured everything of relevance?'' In this dissertation, since I'm examing Rocketship's finances, I need to asssure myself that I have gathered \emph{enough} relevant financial data to draw sound conclusions. In principle, independent auditor's annual reports would be sufficient because the purpose of an independent annual [financial] audit is to present all of the material and financial information needed by regulators, investors, employees, and other stakeholders. Fortunately, there are supplemental data that have the same coverage: the annual budget, and the first and second interim reports. All four should match pretty closely when they are compared.

Since Rocketship schools are charter schools, there additional sources of financial data are available. Charter schools, to be approved, must submit a petition, one of whose required elements is a description of ``financial statements that include a proposed first-year operational budget, including startup costs, and cashflow and financial projections for the first three years of operation.'' (CA Ed. Code §47605(h)). Similarly, charter school renewals have a financial component. Finally, if a charter school is a nonprofit public benefit corportation as Rocketship Education is, there are additional federal financial reporting requirements (IRS Form 990). Again, the data in these documents should tell roughly the same story.

To sum up the limitations of this dissertation, the financial reporting net around Rocketship is comprehensive. However, there is a big loophole: charter schools in California are allowed to contract out all of their operations to a for profit corporation which may keep its finances secret. Effectively, these charter schools can evade most but not all of the financial reporting requirements that apply to nonprofit public benefit charter schools. Rocketship is, however, a nonprofit corporation, so it must expose all of its finances, and anything which is not reported may be obtained using a CPRA (California Public Records Act) request.

One may argue that charter schools were born out of racism and continue to perpetuate that racism. They are merely the educational version of privatization, a movement driven by a search for profit, not educational excellence. They appear to be the social project plaything of billionaires.

\section{Future Research}
One of the realizations that comes from researching charter schools is exactly how massive the marketing of charter schools is. Not only are there think tanks that churn out reports extolling every possible benefit of charter schools, but there are many advocacy organizations whose only purpose is to advocate, advocate, advocate. And behind these think tanks, advocacy organizations, and charter schools, funding them, are a network of right-wing, secretive donors, captains of industry.

Some questions which could be asked are:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]\OnehalfSpacing%
  \item Is there a relationship between LCFF supplemental and concentration grants and Rocketship locations?
  \item How many charter school facilities bonds have defaulted?
  \item What factors make a location desirable to a charter school?
  \item What is the IRR (internal rate of return) of charter school venture funds?
  \item Is there competition among charter schools within a district? If competition among charter schools isn't present, is there a tacit agreement not to poach students?
\end{itemize}

California First Amendment Coalition, that the California Public Records Act did not provide authority for copyrighting government records subject to disclosure under the act. The Court noted that other provisions of California law do expressly provide for the copyright of specific types of materials created by the state.[5] The court noted that:

The Legislature knows how to explicitly authorize public bodies to secure copyrights when it means to do so. For example, the Education Code includes a number of provisions authorizing copyrights, including this one: "Any county board of education may secure copyrights, in the name of the board, to all copyrightable works developed by the board, and royalties or revenue from such copyrights are to be for the benefit of the board securing such copyrights." (Ed. Code, § 1044; see also, e.g., id., §§ 32360, 35170, 72207, 81459.)

** For Roxana on <2021-09-07 Tue>:
- I've taken the summer off.
- I'm fully committed to finishing my dissertation by April 1st. That gives me 6 1/2 months. I think I can commit to 6 hours per weekday.
- I think I'm halfway done for a draft of Chapter 3 good enough to use as a proposal. End of September (or earlier).
- I still need help on crafting good research questions. What's my point?
- What happened to the /Cashing in on Kids/ web site? Too much work for too few views?
- I'm getting pretty discouraged by the steady stream of political setbacks:
  - Texas: anti-abortion & voting rights
  - Biden's ratings
    - Are we supporting him as much as we should?
  - Senators Manchin & Sinema
  - the continued focus on a stolen election
  - the continued absence of focus on the Jan 6th attempted coup
  - the continued absence of focus on Facebook's role in spreading disinformation
  - Jane Mayer's article in the /New Yorker/ on the funding of voter suppression
  - Article on the success of anti-vaxxers in the NY Times 31-Aug-2021, "This is the Moment the Anti-Vaccine Movement Has Been Waiting For"
  - What the hell is wrong with progressives? Why can't we win more often?
  - Newsom & the recall & Reed Hastings & <one other billionaire whose name I forget>
** From 2021-01-12 issue of the Cashing in on Kids newsletter:
Which federal agency has funded more charter school facilities than any other? The U.S. Department of Agriculture. At least according to Chicago-based Wert-Berate,r LLC, the self-described “leading” company in facilitating the charter school industry’s lucrative real estate sector by providing “feasibility studies.”

** The structure of a case study, doctoral dissertation
From /The Dissertation Journey: A Practical and Comprehensive Guide to Planning, Writing, and Defending Your Dissertation, 3/e/, by Carol Roberts and and Laura Hyatt.
- Chapter 1 Problem and purpose
- Chapter 2 Literature review
- Chapter 3 Methodology
- Chapter 4 Case studies
- Chapter 5 Analysis of themes
- Chapter 6 Conclusions, implications, and recommendations
** The charter school industry /modus operandi/
1. Paint a bleak picture of public failure school failure
   - PISA scores suck & have sucked for a long time.
   - Performance is critical to the long term economic success and military security of the United States.
   - More money doesn't help; schools already have gobs of money.
2. Surreptitiously slide into bashing and demonizing {teachers, unions, politicians, socialists, academics, and bureaucrats}, i.e. those who have the knowledge and training to counter the claims and arguments of the charter school industry.
3. Advance a "solution" that ... wait for it ... creates profits. What a surprise.
4. Along the way, call what you're doing with a name which means the opposite of what you're actually doing.
   - Call charter schools "public schools" but don't let the public have any voice in their operation.
   - Claim to put children first, but actually put profits first. 
   - Use words like "academy", "heritage", and "success" to create an aura of long-time academic success.
   - Claim to "innovate", but actually impose a completely profit-oriented structure. 
   - Call yourself "grassroots" but fund your organization with the donations of billionaires.
   - Aggressively promote yourself despite having no educational experience.
*** Public schools need to be failures in order for charter schools to be the solution.
- So, starve public schools of funds, ensuring that they can never meet their goals.
- Impose impossible mandates, like
  - No Child Left Behind (no child, zero, not even one child, an impossible goal)
  - Require (but do not fund) that all children, including those with special needs, be educated. Test them, just to make sure.
  - Design standardized tests administered to *all* students that
    - are age-inappropriate
    - have cut scores that fail 50% (or more) who take them
    - report their results after they might conceivably be useful to teachers
    - are adaptive so that no two students take the same test
    - are secret, so that no public estimate of their reliability, validity, or appropriateness can be calculated
  - Ask schools to address & correct failures over which they have no or little control, like closing the achievement gap or eliminating segregation and discrimination. This, the key mandate of NCLB, is impossible for schools to meet.
- Hold schools accountable for meeting these impossible mandates, and closing those which fail.
- Ignore all issues involving race, diversity, or culture.
** Charter schools must comply with the California Building Standards Code (Part 2 (commencing with Section 101) of Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations)
Do public school districts have to comply? What happens if the district facilities used by the charter schools don't comply?
** Be careful to not appear prejudiced; be neutral.
** Give a context:
- 7000 charter schools

  Support Our Schools Community Discussion Sunday, September 22, 2019 at the Southside Community Center in San José
  *Starts 2:30 pm*
  <https://voteclaudiarossi.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0b057fa2b299f9229ea562485&id=2c7113f90f&e=9cf7b4608e>
  Students are back in the classroom and we want to have a discussion about
  supporting public education. Join parents, neighbors and educators for an
  in-depth conversation and meeting about ways we can support our public
  education system, our teachers and our youth. See flyer for full
  information. 

  We are honored to be joined by Rev. Moore & Roxana Marachi from the NAACP,
  Trustees Brian LoBue & Brian Wheatley and education champion Pastor
  Bymaster.

  This is event is provided with support by the San José/Silicon Valley
  NAACP, In The Public Interest, South Bay Progressive Alliance and BACKPACS
  (Bay Area Collective Keeping Privatizers Away from Community Schools.)

  Our schools and our children need our help, and begins with ensuring the
  community's voice is heard. Please share this event with friends and
  neighbors. I look forward to our September 22 event. Thank you.

-  In solidarity.

  Sincerely,
  <Claudia Rossi>
- why is my study interesting
- heated debates
- many chains
- will focus on Rocketship
- corporate vs community
- avoid one sentence paragraphs
- assumption
- research have found that this effect...
- deep dive to document
- must be replicable and defendable
- charter schools expansion is complicate
- so and so have found....
- quantify the effect -> document the effects that RS
- "data are"
