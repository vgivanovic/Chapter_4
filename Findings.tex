\chapter{Findings}\label{ch:findings}\noindent
\bigskip%

This chapter will present the data found using the approach outlined in \prettyref{ch:methods} with the goal of answering my research question: Has Rocketship structured itself and its finances, to earn a return to investors, focusing especially on real estate transactions, and if so, how?

The first section will give a short historical overvew of Rocketship in \prettyref{sec:history}, including a section on how Rocketship has structured itself. 

Since real estate is so important for Rocketship, the next section, \prettyref{sec:location-and-property-info} will lay out what facilities Rocketship has, where those facilities are located, when they were acquired, and what real estate rights Rocketship has over those properties.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Rocketship History}\label{sec:history}\indent

On February 16, 2005 John Danner, a tech entrepreneur turned educator, filed with the California Secretary of State to incorporate Rocketship Education. Rocketship's initial board consisted of John Danner, Eric Resnick, a specialist in real estate, and Don Shalvey, the CEO and co-founder of Aspire Public Schools, a network of a dozen or so charter schools in California.

\subsection{Rocketship's Corporate Structure}\label{sec:rocketship-corp-struct}\indent

Rocketship's corporate structure was designed from the start to separate schools and their operation from facilities and their construction and maintenance. Rocketship Education is the parent company, a 501(3)(c) non-profit. It owns all the schools, themselves non-profits, plus Launchpad Development Company, another non-profit. Launchpad Development's role is to own all the facilities, one non-profit LLC per location. This structure is diagrammed in \prettyref{fig:RSED-corporate-structure}.

\subsubsection{Petitions \& Renewals}\label{sec:petitions-renewals}\indent

The current number of pages of initial and renewal petitions runs to 7371 pages for just Rocketship schools in Santa Clara County.\footnote{The massive size of some of these petition calls into question whether authorizers read them in their entirety.}

\subsubsection{Venture Funds}\label{sec:findings-venture-funds}\indent

\subsubsection{Tax Credits}\label{sec:findings-tax-credits}\indent

The New Market Tax credit of 39\% (5\% for the first 3 years, and 6\% for the remaining 4 years) can be applied to taxes due from other investments. Since there is a compounding effect, the 39\% is actually worth over 41\% of the initial investment. Note that these other investment may themselves have a return. With these kinds of incentives, it's no wonder that the New Markets Tax Credit is popular. But one should not be deceived into thinking that just because New Markets Tax Credits must be made in economically depressed area that investors are investing out of the goodness of their heart. The tax credit investment is nearly without risk because the tax credit is guaranteed as long as the charter school remains open. If the school stays open for seven years, the risk is zero.

\subsubsection{Bonds}\label{sec:findings-bonds}\indent

 Three bond prospectuses total over 1000 pages.    

% \subsection{Real Estate Data}\label{sec:real-estate-data}\indent

\section{Gaps and Anomalies}\label{sec:findings-gaps-anomolies}\indent

Since a goal of this dissertation is to map the flow of money into and out of Rocketship, I will use diagrams similar to the one used by \citeauthor{Baker.Miron2015} (\citeyear{Baker.Miron2015}), which is reproduced here as \prettyref{fig:opresflows}.

\subsection{Triangulation}\label{sec:findings-triangulation}\indent

These data represent the monies that are flowing into Rocketship/Launchpad related to facilities, real estate, bonds, loans, and donations and not tied to the number of students. Once that's been assembled, roll up into one spreadsheet, Rocketship's consolidated financial statements for the fourteen years (2008--2022). The consolidated financial statements can then be compared against the known real estate, bond, loan, and donation transactions. Noe where data is missing or where it conflicts with the consolidated financial statements.

In this example, money flows from left to right, and there are no loops. Colors are used merely to distinguish the various blocks.
