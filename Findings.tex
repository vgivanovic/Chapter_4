\chapter{Findings}\label{ch:findings}\noindent
\bigskip%

This chapter will present the data found using the approach outlined in \prettyref{ch:methods} with the goal of answering my research question: Has Rocketship structured itself and its finances, to earn a return to investors, focusing especially on real estate transactions, and if so, how?

The first section will give a short historical overvew of Rocketship in \prettyref{sec:history}, including a section on how Rocketship has structured itself. 

Since real estate is so important for Rocketship, the next section, \prettyref{sec:location-and-property-info} will lay out what facilities Rocketship has, where those facilities are located, when they were acquired, and what real estate rights Rocketship has over those properties.

\section{Rocketship History}\label{sec:history}\indent

On February 16, 2006 John Danner, a tech entrepreneur turned educator, filed with the California Secretary of State incorporation papers for Rocketship Education. Rocketship's initial Board of Directors consisted of John Danner, Eric Resnick, a specialist in real estate, and Don Shalvey, the CEO and co-founder of Aspire Public Schools, a network of a dozen or so charter schools in California. Preston Smith, an educator and a Teach for America alumnus, was hired to be Rocketship's first principal. He later became Rocketship's CEO. Jennifer Andaluz, also an educator, joined the Rocketship Board of Directors before it opened. Smith and Andaluz were designated co-founders by Danner.

Danner chose to open his first school in the San José Unified School District. Danner prepared a 300 page petition that he submitted to the San José Unified School District on 04 May 2006, which held a public hearing on the matter on 20 June 2006. On 13 July 2006, the SJUSD Board of Education denied his petition, again at a public meeting.

Danner appealed this denial to the Santa Clara County Board of Education and presented a modified petition that – as far as the SCCBOE was concerned – overcame the objections raised by the SJUSD. They conditionally approved Danner's first charter school at their 18 October 2006 meeting. The school opened in August 2007 for the 2007-08 school year.

As of 2023, Rocketship has expanded to 23 schools in California, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Washington, D.C. and Texas, ten of which are in Santa Clara County. \prettyref{tab:RocketshipSchools} on page \pageref{tab:RocketshipSchools} lists those ten, when they opened, and when they submitted initial petitions and renewal petitions.

Opening schools did not go smoothly for Danner and Rocketship. Not only was there community opposition, but various organizations also opposed opening one or more charter schools in Santa Clara County, in particular the Education Committee of the San Jose/Silicon Valley NAACP opposed opening the Los Sueños school in April of 2020\parencite{MooreII.Marachi2020}.
% These oppositions to Rocketship schools in Santa Clara County are listed in \prettyref{tab:opposition}.

%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table}
The most consequential opposition was a 2014 lawsuit brought by the Alum Rock, Evergreen, Franklin-McKinley and Mount Pleasant school districts which contended that the SCCOE had exceeded its authority in approving in advance 20 county-wide Rocketship charters, bypassing local school districts as authorizers. At the time of the lawsuit, 3 Rocketship charters had opened under this county-wide authorization, and in a settlement, Rocketship agreed not to seek to open 13 of the 20 charters. In the end, only 5 county-wide charters opened\footnote{Sharon Noguchi reported that nearly \$500K was spent on this lawsuit\parencite{Noguchi2015}.}

\subsection{Rocketship's Corporate Structure}\label{sec:rocketship-corp-struct}\indent

Rocketship's corporate structure was designed from the start to separate schools and their operation from facilities and their construction and maintenance. Rocketship Education, Inc. is the parent company, a 501(3)(c) non-profit. It owns all the schools, themselves non-profits, plus Launchpad Development Company, another non-profit. Launchpad Development's role is to own all the facilities, one non-profit LLC per location. This structure is diagrammed in \prettyref{fig:RSED-corporate-structure}.

\section{Charter School Financing}\label{sec:findings-charter-financing}\indent

Financing charter schools in California is complex, complicated, and different from the financing of traditional public schools. \prettyref{tab:charter-financing-options} describes what financing options a charter school has compared to a traditional public school.

The first two sources of financing, i.e.~revenue, are always available to both public schools and to charter schools, although the amounts and timing of the distributions might vary. 

\begin{description}[nosep]\OnehalfSpacing%
  \medskip\item[LCFF] Local Control Funding Formula. A charter's home district passes through an amount based on a school's demographics and ADA (Average Daily Attendance). All schools have the same base grant adjusted for grade spans.  If a school has students who are low income (i.e.~they are eligible for free or reduced price meals (FRPM)), or they are English Learners (EL), or they are foster youth, the school receives a supplemental grant of 20\% of its adjusted base grant. If the qualifying population of students exceeds 55\% of the total, a school receives 65\% of the adjusted base grant for every student above the 55\% threshold.

Since all Rocketship schools have at least 55\% of their students , the school qualifies for a LCFF concentration grant in addition to a LCFF supplemental grant. Each qualifying student over the 55\% threshold is entitled to an additional 65\% of the LCFF base grant. Each qualifying student is entitled to an additional 20\% over the base LCFF grant. 

The most succinct summary of how the final LCFF amounts are calculated is give by the California Department of Education on its web site:

\begin{quotation}
  \noindent{}``Funding entitlements under the LCFF consist of:\\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Grade span-specific base grants based on ADA, that reflect adjustments for grades K–3 class sizes and grades 9–12 (school districts with qualifying schools may receive a necessary small school (NSS) allowance in lieu of the base grants);
    \item Supplemental grants equal to 20 percent of the adjusted base grants multiplied by the LEA’s unduplicated percentage of English learners, income eligible for free or reduced-price meals, and foster youth pupils;
    \item Concentration grants equal to 65 percent of the adjusted base grants multiplied by an LEA’s percentage of unduplicated pupils above 55 percent;
    \item Two add-ons equal to the amounts school districts received in 2012–13 for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant and Home-to-School Transportation programs;
    \item An Economic Recovery Target add-on; and
    \item Beginning in 2022–23, an add-on for current year Transitional Kindergarten ADA.
    \item Base, supplemental, and concentration grants, as well as necessary small school allowances, receive cost-of-living adjustments as provided through the annual budget. Beginning in 2023–24, transportation related add-ons and the Transitional Kindergarten add-on will also receive cost-of-living adjustments.''
  \end{itemize}

  \medskip\item[Local property tax] Traditional public school districts are granted the right to tax themselves, using a non-ad valorem tax, by levying a tax per parcel, guaranteed by the value of the district property\footnote{A 2023 court decision allowed a tax based on square footage}.\\

The New Market Tax credit of 39\% (5\% for the first 3 years, and 6\% for the remaining 4 years) can be applied to taxes due from other investments. Since there is a compounding effect, the 39\% is actually worth over 41\% of the initial investment. Note that these other investment may themselves have a return. With these kinds of incentives, it's no wonder that the New Markets Tax Credit is popular. But one should not be deceived into thinking that just because New Markets Tax Credits must be made in economically depressed area that investors are investing out of the goodness of their heart. The tax credit investment is nearly without risk because the tax credit is guaranteed as long as the charter school remains open. If the school stays open for seven years, the risk is zero.

Since a goal of this dissertation is to map the flow of money into and out of Rocketship, I will use diagrams similar to the one used by \citeauthor{Baker.Miron2015} (\citeyear{Baker.Miron2015}), which is reproduced here as \prettyref{fig:opresflows}.

\subsection{Triangulation}\label{sec:findings-triangulation}\indent

These data represent the monies that are flowing into Rocketship/Launchpad related to facilities, real estate, bonds, loans, and donations and not tied to the number of students. Once that's been assembled, roll up into one spreadsheet, Rocketship's consolidated financial statements for the fourteen years (2008--2022). The consolidated financial statements can then be compared against the known real estate, bond, loan, and donation transactions. Noe where data is missing or where it conflicts with the consolidated financial statements.
