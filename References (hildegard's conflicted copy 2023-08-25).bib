  urldate = {2019-06-17},
  abstract = {In political science and sociology, elite theory is a theory of the state that seeks to describe and explain power relationships in contemporary society. The theory posits that a small minority, consisting of members of the economic elite and policy-planning networks, holds the most power—and that this power is independent of democratic elections. Through positions in corporations or on corporate boards, and influence over policy-planning networks through financial support of foundations or positions with think tanks or policy-discussion groups, members of the "elite" exert significant power over corporate and government decisions. The basic characteristics of this theory are that power is concentrated, the elites are unified, the non-elites are diverse and powerless, elites' interests are unified due to common backgrounds and positions and the defining characteristic of power is institutional position.Elite theory opposes pluralism, a tradition that assumes that all individuals, or at least the multitude of social groups, have equal power and balance each other out in contributing to democratic political outcomes representing the emergent, aggregate will of society. Elite theory argues either that democracy is a utopian folly, as it is traditionally viewed in the conservative Italian tradition, or that democracy is not realizable within capitalism, as is the view of the more Marxist-compatible contemporary elite theory permutation. Even when entire groups are ostensibly completely excluded from the state's traditional networks of power (historically, on the basis of arbitrary criteria such as nobility, race, gender, or religion), elite theory recognizes that "counter-elites" frequently develop within such excluded groups. Negotiations between such disenfranchised groups and the state can be analyzed as negotiations between elites and counter-elites. A major problem, in turn, is the ability of elites to co-opt counter-elites.},

  abstract = {Logical positivism, later called logical empiricism, and both of which together are also known as neopositivism, was a movement in Western philosophy whose central thesis was the verification principle (also known as the verifiability criterion of meaning). This theory of knowledge asserted that only statements verifiable through direct observation or logical proof are meaningful in terms of conveying truth value, information or factual content. Starting in the late 1920s, groups of philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians formed the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle, which, in these two cities, would propound the ideas of logical positivism. Flourishing in several European centres through the 1930s, the movement sought to prevent confusion rooted in unclear language and unverifiable claims by converting philosophy into "scientific philosophy", which, according to the logical positivists, ought to share the bases and structures of empirical sciences' best examples, such as Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. Despite its ambition to overhaul philosophy by studying and mimicking the extant conduct of empirical science, logical positivism became erroneously stereotyped as a movement to regulate the scientific process and to place strict standards on it.After World War II, the movement shifted to a milder variant, logical empiricism, led mainly by Carl Hempel, who, during the rise of Nazism, had immigrated into the United States. In the ensuing years, the movement's central premises, still unresolved, were heavily criticised by leading philosophers, particularly Willard van Orman Quine and Karl Popper, and even, within the movement itself, by Hempel. The 1962 publication of Thomas Kuhn's landmark book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions dramatically shifted academic philosophy's focus. In 1967 philosopher John Passmore pronounced logical positivism "dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes".},

  abstract = {Positivism is a philosophical theory that holds that all genuine knowledge is either positive—a posteriori and exclusively derived from experience of natural phenomena and their properties and relations—or true by definition, that is, analytic and tautological. Thus, information derived from sensory experience, as interpreted through reason and logic, forms the exclusive source of all certain knowledge.Verified data (positive facts) received from the senses are known as empirical evidence; thus positivism is based on empiricism.Sociological positivism holds that society, like the physical world, operates according to general laws. Introspective and intuitive knowledge is rejected, as are metaphysics and theology because metaphysical and theological claims cannot be verified by sense experience. Although the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of western thought, the modern approach was formulated by the philosopher Auguste Comte in the early 19th century. Comte argued that, much as the physical world operates according to gravity and other absolute laws, so does society.},

  abstract = {In philosophy, empiricism is a theory that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience.  It is one of several views of epistemology, along with rationalism and skepticism. Empiricism emphasizes the role of empirical evidence in the formation of ideas, rather than innate ideas or traditions. However, empiricists may argue that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences.Historically, empiricism was associated with the "blank slate" concept (tabula rasa), according to which the human mind is "blank" at birth and develops its thoughts only through experience.Empiricism in the philosophy of science emphasizes evidence, especially as discovered in experiments. It is a fundamental part of the scientific method that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on a priori reasoning, intuition, or revelation. Empiricism, often used by natural scientists, says that "knowledge is based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and falsification". Empirical research, including experiments and validated measurement tools, guides the scientific method.},

In other cases, a similar subsidy may be provided by the state through a school voucher program. Other school choice options include open enrollment laws (which allow students to attend public schools outside the district in which the students live), charter schools, magnet schools, virtual schools, homeschooling, education savings accounts (ESAs), and individual tax credits or deductions for educational expenses.},

  abstract = {We study the formation of a ruling coalition in political environments. Each individual is endowed with a level of political power. The ruling coalition consists of a subset of the individuals in the society and decides the distribution of resources. A ruling coalition needs to contain enough powerful members to win against any alternative coalition that may challenge it, and it needs to be self-enforcing, in the sense that none of its sub-coalitions should be able to secede and become the new ruling coalition. We first present an axiomatic approach that captures these notions and determines a (generically) unique ruling coalition. We then construct a simple dynamic game that encompasses these ideas and prove that the sequentially weakly dominant equilibria (and the Markovian trembling hand perfect equilibria) of this game coincide with the set of ruling coalitions of the axiomatic approach. We also show the equivalence of these notions to the core of a related non-transferable utility cooperative game. In all cases, the nature of the ruling coalition is determined by the power constraint, which requires that the ruling coalition be powerful enough, and by the enforcement constraint, which imposes that no sub-coalition of the ruling coalition that commands a majority is self-enforcing. The key insight that emerges from this characterization is that the coalition is made self-enforcing precisely by the failure of its winning sub-coalitions to be self-enforcing. This is most simply illustrated by the following simple finding: with a simple majority rule, while three-person (or larger) coalitions can be self-enforcing, two-person coalitions are generically not self-enforcing. Therefore, the reasoning in this paper suggests that three-person juntas or councils should be more common than two-person ones. In addition, we provide conditions under which the grand coalition will be the ruling coalition and conditions under which the most powerful individuals will not be included in the ruling coalition. We also use this framework to discuss endogenous party formation.},

  abstract = {This report discusses an approach to research and engagement that we call Community Research Collaboratives. Our goal is to further define and elevate an existing field of work currently under-recognized by academic researchers, philanthropists, and educational pol- icymakers and practitioners. We describe CRCs as partnerships among community mem- bers, researchers, and/or educational institutions that work together to advance equity and justice by jointly creating new knowledge, policies, and/or practices that promote systemic change in educational systems and society. To initiate this study, we reached out to two funding organizations and two networks supporting research partnerships, conducting in- terviews of six leaders in order to vet the working definition. Using the resulting criteria, we identified seven existing collaboratives to learn from as subjects of this research. Subse- quent interviews with 12 participants across these collaboratives yielded the following four core features of CRCs: (1) their commitment to systemic transformation, (2) their challenge to current knowledge structures as they prioritize community goals, (3) their understanding of research as a developmental process, and (4) their attention to effective collaboration. This report fleshes out these ideas and provides detailed snapshots of some of the represen- tative organizations to illustrate how the core features are manifested in practice. We intend our analysis to highlight the unique attributes of CRCs, to boost their visibility in education, and to encourage funding support for this growing field.},

  abstract = {Serverless containers and functions are widely used for deploying and managing software in the cloud. Their popularity is due to reduced cost of operations, improved utilization of hardware, and faster scaling than traditional deployment methods. The economics and scale of serverless applications demand that workloads from multiple customers run on the same hardware with minimal overhead, while preserving strong security and performance isolation. The traditional view is that there is a choice between virtualization with strong security and high overhead, and container technologies with weaker security and minimal overhead. This tradeoff is unacceptable to public infrastructure providers, who need both strong security and minimal overhead. To meet this need, we developed Firecracker, a new open source Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) specialized for serverless workloads, but generally useful for containers, functions and other compute workloads within a reasonable set of constraints. We have deployed Firecracker in two publically-available serverless compute services at Amazon Web Services (Lambda and Fargate), where it supports millions of production workloads, and trillions of requests per month. We describe how specializing for serverless informed the design of Firecracker, and what we learned from seamlessly migrating Lambda customers to Firecracker.},

I examine how the definition of harm espoused by the U.S. Supreme Court in Brown, which identified harm as internal (or related to the psyche rather than as material), elided the question of resources and allowed for the continuance of racebased inequality in education to be explained as resulting from an embodied inferiority. I suggest that what has come to be termed the achievement gap is indicative the way in which this post-Brown resolution to inequality is articulated. I examine a substratum of the achievement gap—the word gap—that has become an increasing focus of recent education policy initiatives.},

In analyzing how participants advocate closing the achievement gaps that affect Latina/o and Chicana/o students, I find that participants’ political discourse is shaped by concepts such as “niceness,” “respect,” and “decorum,” which ultimately limits their critique and silences the experiences of students in their communities.

As the United States celebrates the nation's "triumph over race" with the election of Barack Obama, the majority of young black men in major American cities are locked behind bars or have been labeled felons for life. Although Jim Crow laws have been wiped off the books, an astounding percentage of the African American community remains trapped in a subordinate status - much like their grandparents before them. In this incisive critique, former litigator-turned-legal-scholar Michelle Alexander provocatively argues that we have not ended racial caste in America: we have simply redesigned it. Alexander shows that, by targeting black men and decimating communities of color, the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, even as it formally adheres to the principle of color blindness. The New Jim Crow challenges the civil rights community - and all of us - to place mass incarceration at the forefront of a new movement for racial justice in America},

  abstract = {Much research has tried to parse the school’s contribution to children’s learning apart from the family’s and the family’s contribution apart from the school’s as though they were discrete and separable. The 1966 Equality of Educational Opportunity report helped launch this agenda, finding in favor of family. In this essay I argue that the framing of the issue as “family versus school” is fundamentally flawed. Rather, family and school (and neighborhood) together shape children’s academic development. I argue that the strong effect associated with school socioeconomic composition in the original report, and stronger still in more recent studies, is in fact an expression of family influence: family determines where children live and the schools they attend. But it is a school influence as well. When properties of family, neighborhood, and school overlap, as they do under conditions of extreme neighborhood and school segregation, poor children’s profile has them triply disadvantaged. The same ecological perspective on children’s learning implies that by reducing the degree of overlap across these “overlapping spheres of influence,” school socioeconomic context can function instead to offset family disadvantage. Relevant literatures are reviewed and the concluding section considers the potential of socioeconomic integration at the school level as a policy lever for improving poor children’s educational prospects.},

This finding has been widely reported in the news media and cited in several editorials favoring UC’s continued use of SAT/ACT scores in university admissions. But the claim is spurious, the statistical artifact of a classic methodological error: omitted variable bias. Compared to high-school grades, SAT/ACT scores are much more strongly correlated with student demographics like family income, parental education, and race/ethnicity. As a result, when researchers omit student demographics in their prediction models, the predictive value of the tests is artificially inflated. When student demographics are included in the model, the findings are reversed: High-school grades in collegepreparatory courses are actually the stronger predictor of UC student outcomes. The Task Force should go back to the drawing board and provide the UC community with more realistic estimates of the true value-added by the tests.},

AlphaGo won all but the fourth game; all games were won by resignation. The match has been compared with the historic chess match between Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov in 1997. The winner of the match was slated to win \$1 million. Since AlphaGo won, Google DeepMind stated that the prize will be donated to charities, including UNICEF, and Go organisations. Lee received \$170,000 (\$150,000 for participating in the five games and an additional \$20,000 for winning one game).After the match, The Korea Baduk Association awarded AlphaGo the highest Go grandmaster rank – an "honorary 9 dan".

Positive political theory, or rational choice theory, represents the attempt to build formal models of collective decision-making processes, often relying on the assumption of selfinterested rational action. This method has been used to study such political processes as elections, legislative behavior, public goods, and treaty formation and diplomatic strategy in international relations. In this article, we provide a retrospective account of the Rochester school, which discusses Riker’s theoretical synthesis and his institution building in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. We discuss some of the most important Rochester school contributions related to spatial models of voting, agenda setting, structure-induced equilibria, heresthetics, game theory, and political theory. We also briefly situate positive political theory within the larger context of political science and economics.},

  abstract = {The integration of gestures and pictures into pedagogy has demonstrated potential for improving adults’ learning of foreign language (L2) vocabulary. However, the relative benefits of gestures and pictures on children’s L2 vocabulary learning have not been formally evaluated. In three experiments, we investigated the effects of gesture-based and picture-based learning on 8-year-old primary school children’s acquisition of novel L2 vocabulary. In each experiment, German children were trained over 5 consecutive days on auditorily presented, concrete and abstract, English vocabulary. In Experiments 1 and 2, gesture enrichment (auditorily presented L2 words accompanied with self-performed gestures) was compared with a non-enriched baseline condition. In Experiment 3, gesture enrichment was compared with picture enrichment (auditorily presented words accompanied with pictures). Children performed vocabulary recall and translation tests at 3 days, 2 months, and 6 months post-learning. Both gesture and picture enrichment enhanced children’s test performance compared with non-enriched learning. Benefits of gesture and picture enrichment persisted up to 6 months after training and occurred for both concrete and abstract words. Gesture-enriched learning was hypothesized to boost learning outcomes more than picture-enriched learning on the basis of previous findings in adults. Unexpectedly, however, we observed similar benefits of gesture and picture enrichment on children’s L2 learning. These findings suggest that both gestures and pictures enhance children’s L2 learning and that performance benefits are robust over long timescales.},

Charter attendance increases pass rates on the high-stakes exam required for high school graduation in Massachusetts, with especially large effects on the likelihood of qualifying for a state-sponsored college scholarship. Charter attendance has little effect on the likelihood of taking the SAT, but shifts the distribution of scores rightward, moving students into higher quartiles of the state SAT score distribution. Boston's charter high schools also increase the likelihood of taking an Advanced Placement (AP) exam, the number of AP exams taken, and scores on AP Calculus tests. Finally, charter attendance induces a substantial shift from two- to four-year institutions, though the effect on overall college enrollment is modest. The increase in four-year enrollment is concentrated among four-year public institutions in Massachusetts. The large gains generated by Boston's charter high schools are unlikely to be generated by changes in peer composition or other peer effects.},

  abstract = {Following a 2007 Supreme Court decision restricting the use of race for school assignments, school boards desiring greater diversity turned to economic integration, meaning equalizing the proportion of low-income students in each school in a district. Among other claimed benefits, most advocates believe economic integration will reduce the achievement gap between low- and high- income students. The integration is often accomplished using “controlled choice,” a method of assigning students to schools by giving parents some degree of “choice” among the public schools in their district. In larger school districts, controlled-choice plans can generate controversy and middle-class flight among parents who prefer neighborhood schools, similar to the “white flight” observed in earlier decades when mandatory busing was used to attain racially balanced schools. A review of controlled-choice plans in six large dis- tricts in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Florida shows considerable and ongoing higher-income and white losses in these districts. While other demographic forces cannot be ruled out (e.g., urban to suburban movement for reasons unrelated to schools), neither can the unpopularity of controlled choice. More important, none of these districts has demonstrated significant closing of achievement gaps between higher- and lower-income students, one of the main justifications for these plans.},

\item Armor admits his analysis is meaningless when the abstract concedes the point: While other demographic forces can-\\
not be ruled out (e.g., urban to suburban movement for\\
reasons unrelated to schools), neither can the unpopular-\\
ity of controlled choice." (p.1)

\item Armor implies that an integration plan must close the achievement gap: "More important, none of these districts has demonstrated significant closing of achievement gaps between higher- and lower-income students, one of the main justifications for these plans." (p.1) I agree that that was the hope, but there are other, perhaps unvoiced, reasons to adopt an integration plan. Fairness comes to mind.

The answer is a decisive “no.” There is no persuasive evidence that scores on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) have risen among college students in recent decades. In any case, the NPI is a dubious measure of narcissism, and college students are a dubious sample of emerging adults. There is evidence that today’s emerging adults have high expectations and are confident in their abilities, but these qualities should be seen as psychological resources during a life stage that is often difficult. If it were true that their narcissism was rising and that narcissism leads to impulsive behavior, then impulsive behavior would also be rising, but in fact it is diminishing across multiple indicators. As a society, we can and should do more to support emerging adults, beginning with a halt to the negative stereotypes.},

  abstract = {"As political science has come to depend more and more on quantitative methods, with a significant focus on causal identification (put simply, "what causes what"), there has been a growing concern that the questions scholars address are getting smaller, shrinking to include only those topics for which the so-called "identification problem" can be satisfactorily solved. Yet even if this problem cannot yet be solved for many important and complex topics--democracy, inequality, violence, stability, and many more--there is much left to learn; in particular, clear theories that provide better insight into the central mechanisms at work. These theories can help orient new empirical work, thus fueling a virtuous cycle between empirical and theoretical insights. In this ambitious book. Ashworth et al address this key challenge in the field with a new vision of how to connect empirical and theoretical work, one rooted in the idea of "all else equal." Theory, the authors argue, implicitly rests of the idea of "all-else-equal," and it's precisely this question that empirical work attempts to confirm. Thus theory and empirics have an intrinsic connection, and in recognizing this scholars can bridge the gap between the two. The first part of the book examines the "all-else-equal" connection and goes on to show how how theoretical models yield empirical implications and how substantive identification is the lynch-pin of a credible research design. The second part then follows the progressive back-and-forth between theory and empirics in existing scholarship, breaking these interactions into five types: reinterpreting, elaboration, distinguishing, disentangling, and modeling the research design. Each chapter in this section provides concrete examples, discussing a handful of papers that illustrates the relevant interaction between theory and empirics. The overall goal of the book is to facilitate a closer and more productive interaction between theory and empirics in social science"--},

  abstract = {School choice systems aspire to delink residential location and school assignments by allowing children to apply to schools outside of their neighborhood. However, the introduction of choice programs affect incentives to live in certain neighborhoods, which may undermine the goals of choice programs. We investigate this possibility by developing a model of public school and residential choice. We consider two variants, one with an exogenous outside option and one endogenizing the outside option by considering interactions between two adjacent towns. In both cases, school choice rules narrow the range between the highest and lowest quality schools compared to neighborhood assignment rules, and these changes in school quality are capitalized into equilibrium housing prices. This compressed distribution generates incentives for both the highest and lowest types to move out of cities with school choice, typically producing worse outcomes for low types than neighborhood assignment rules. Paradoxically, even when choice results in improvement in the worst performing schools, the lowest type residents may not benefit.},

The second article, by Knight and Mendoza, combines data from the Census Fiscal Survey with data from the California Department of Education to explore whether differences in data on and measures of school funding equity matter (i.e., lead to similar or different conclusions) when evaluating the effects of California’s 2013 adoption of the Local Control Funding Formula.},

  author = {Baker, Bruce D},
  pages = {73},
  abstract = {Some communities look at claims of miraculous proficiency rates or heed reports of long waiting lists for charter schools and conclude that chartering is the way to go. But if the broad, long-term policy objective is to move toward the provision of a “system of great schools” that produces an equitable distribution of excellent (or at the very least adequate) educational opportunities for all children, chartering must pass a much more thoughtful examination. Other reports have shown how high test scores and popularity of charter schools could be the byproducts of using data from cherry-picked charter schools that serve cherry-picked or culled populations. This report adds further insights for the debate on how expanding charter schools as a policy alternative achieves the broader goal. Specifically, it shows that charter expansion may increase inequity, introduce inefficiencies and redundancies, compromise financial stability, and introduce other objectionable distortions to the system that impede delivery of an equitable distribution of excellent or at least adequate education to all children. By shedding light on the risks of charter expansion, it provides elements for a decisionmaking process that weighs the costs against expected benefits. The report concludes with a checklist of items decision-makers must consider when evaluating charter expansion in their communities.},

  abstract = {Virtual schooling was first employed in the mid-1990s and has become a common method of distance education used in K-12 jurisdictions. The most accepted definition of a virtual school is an entity approved by a state or governing body that offers courses through distance delivery – most commonly using the Internet. While virtual schools can be classified in different ways, the three common methods of delivery are by independent, asynchronous or synchronous means. Presently, the vast majority of virtual school students tended to be a select group of academically capable, motivated, independent learners. The benefits associated with virtual schooling are expanding educational access, providing high-quality learning opportunities, improving student outcomes and skills, allowing for educational choice, and achieving administrative efficiency. However, the research to support these conjectures is limited at best. The challenges associated with virtual schooling include the conclusion that the only students typically successful in online learning environments are those who have independent orientations towards learning, highly motivated by intrinsic sources, and have strong time management, literacy, and technology skills. These characteristics are typically associated with adult learners. This stems from the fact that research into and practice of distance education has typically been targeted to adult learners. The problem with this focus is that adults learn differently than younger learners. Researchers are calling for more research into the factors that account for K-12 student success in distance education and virtual school environments and more design research approaches than traditional comparisons of student achievement in traditional and virtual schools.},

Based on the limited research to date some students can experience success in the supplemental K-12 online learning environment, but other types of K-12 online learning are largely failing to adequately serve students. While proponents will argue that all types of K-12 online learning are forms of school choice, it is primarily cyber charter schools and course choice policies that are reflective of the policies and regulations proponents of school choice promote – as cyber charter schools and course choice policies are designed to open up markets to K-12 online learning providers. Yet, proponents continue to advocate for decreasing the amount of oversight for K-12 online providers. The combination of dramatic, unchecked growth and an almost complete inability to assure any measure of quality has resulted in abysmal student performance in many K-12 online learning environments.},

Proponents of these programs argue that by the usual market logic, choice and competition will improve the quality of the education that schools provide. Critics counter that the usual market logic does not translate easily to schools, since households’ perceptions of school quality depend not only on the efforts of school personnel but also on the composition of the student body (i.e., households have peer preferences). This paper advances this debate by developing and analyzing an economic model of public school choice. To capture the pro-choice argument, the model assumes that a neighborhood enrollment policy that provides schools with no incentives to exert effort is replaced by a prototypical public school choice policy in which households have a free choice of school and schools have incentives to compete for students. To capture the anti-choice argument the model assumes that households have peer preferences. The analysis of the equilibrium of this model generates three findings that highlight potential limitations of choice programs.},

  abstract = {In a well-publicized study, Gilens and Page argue that economic elites and business interest groups exert strong influence on US government policy while average citizens have virtually no influence at all. Their conclusions are drawn from a model which is said to reveal the causal impact of each group’s preferences. It is shown here that the test on which the original study is based is prone to underestimating the impact of citizens at the 50th income percentile by a wide margin. In addition, descriptive analysis of the authors’ dataset reveals that average Americans have received their preferred policy outcome roughly as often as elites have when the two groups have disagreed with each other. Evidence that average citizens are effectively ignored by the policy process may not be as strong as is suggested by the authors.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms can be found in virtually any environment. In humans, the largest collection of microorganisms is found in the gut ecosystem. The adult gut microbiome consists of more genes than its human host and typically spans more than 60 genera from across the taxonomic tree. In addition, the gut contains the largest number of neurons in the body, after the brain. In recent years, it has become clear that the gut microbiome is in communication with the brain, through the gut–brain axis. A growing body of literature shows that the gut microbiome plays a shaping role in a variety of psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). In this review, the interplay between the microbiome and MDD is discussed in three facets. First, we discuss factors that affect the onset/development of MDD that also greatly impinge on the composition of the gut microbiota—especially diet and stressful life events. We then examine the interplay between the microbiota and MDD. We examine evidence suggesting that the microbiota is altered in MDD, and we discuss why the microbiota should be considered during MDD treatment. Finally, we look toward the future and examine how the microbiota might become a therapeutic target for MDD. This review is intended to introduce those familiar with the neurological and psychiatric aspects of MDD to the microbiome and its potential role in the disorder. Although research is in its very early days, with much yet to be the understood, the microbiome is offering new avenues for developing potentially novel strategies for managing MDD.},

No Child Left Behind (NCLB), also known as the 2001 Re-Authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, was focused on holding schools accountable for achieving academic proficiency standards. The School Choice policy provided parents of students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, assigned to underperforming schools, with an option to choose a different public school.  This document includes an overview of School Choice, as well as a detailed review of the historical and political context that shaped the policy. The latter part of the essay explains the impact of the policy on schools and students and provides an overall critique of the policy’s effectiveness. This paper was written based on eight peer reviewed articles, as well as the Department of Education website, which provided much of the detail surrounding the logistics of the policy.},

  abstract = {Recent reports suggest that the vast majority (up to 97\%) of parents with children in “failing” schools choose to leave their children in those schools, even when it is their legal right to do otherwise. These reports -- and the puzzling behavior they describe -- draw attention to researchers’ limited ability to explain parents’ actions. This study addresses this limitation by investigating the “black box” of choice -- the processes parents use to choose. Based on interviews with 48 urban parents during the eight months preceding the selection of a middle or high school, the study finds that differences in the choice process did not explain why parents chose failing schools. Instead, differences in choice sets explain, in part, why parents choose the schools they do. Using social networks, customary attendance patterns, and their understanding of their child’s academic achievement, parents constructed choice sets that varied systematically by social-class background. The differences between parents’ choice sets were statistically significant and provide insight into why it makes sense that well-intentioned parents choose failing schools. The study’s findings elaborate our understanding of the choice process and, in so doing, raise concerns about the ability of current choice policies to deliver the equity outcomes reformers suggest.},

  abstract = {Updated to reflect the latest developments and increasing scope of school-based options, the second edition of the Handbook of Research on School Choice makes readily available the most rigorous and policy-relevant research on K–12 school choice. This comprehensive research handbook begins with scholarly overviews that explore historical, political, economic, legal, methodological, and international perspectives on school choice. In the following sections, experts examine the research and current state of common forms of school choice: charter schools, school vouchers, and magnet schools. The concluding section brings together perspectives on other key topics such as accountability, tax credit scholarships, parent decision-making, and marginalized students. With empirical perspectives on all aspects of this evolving sphere of education, this is a critical resource for researchers, faculty, and students interested in education policy, the politics of education, and educational leadership.},

  abstract = {Charter schools have been on the educational reform landscape for over twenty years. In the last ten years, a number of rigorous studies have examined the effects of these schools on student achievement and educational attainment. Findings reveal mixed results where student achievement is concerned (i.e., some positive, some negative, some neutral) and positive results in terms of educational attainment (i.e., high school graduation and college attendance). The article places this research within a framework that draws on both market and institutional theories, and concludes that additional research on the social organization of charter schools and traditional public schools is needed to better understand the conditions under which school choice is or is not effective.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade a rising chorus of critics - from William Bennett to Allan Bloom - has decried the supposedly dire state of our public schools. Kids aren't learning what they should, violence and chaos reign in the classroom, and bureaucracy strangles attempts at reform. But how much of that grim image is really true? In The Manufactured Crisis, two prominent scholars, prize-winning educational psychologist David C. Berliner and leading social psychologist Bruce J. Biddle, fight back with the good news. They debunk a whole series of familiar but untrue statistics about public schools - that SAT scores have been dropping, when for many groups they are in fact rising; that illiteracy is up, when in fact the numbers have been skewed because schools are now educating the traditionally disenfranchised in ever larger numbers; that investments in public education do not pay off when, in fact, they lead to greater student achievements and life earnings; that private schools are inherently better than public schools when, in fact, the evidence does not support this charge. Berliner and Biddle tear through these and other sensational myths to give the reader an honest look at public education in America and the misguided, often tragic proposals that critics have urged for correcting these fictive problems. In addition, they expose and offer solutions to the real problems American public schools face today, schools that continue to provide an increasingly diverse citizenry with the opportunity to better their lives.},

  abstract = {The U.S. has set as a national goal the narrowing of the achievement gap between lower  income  and  middle-class  students,  and  that  between  racial  and  ethnic groups.  This  is  a  key  purpose  of  the  No  Child  Left Behind  act,  which  relies primarily  on  assessment  to  promote  changes  within  schools  to  accomplish  that goal.  However,  out-of-school  factors  (OSFs)  play  a powerful  role  in  generating existing  achievement  gaps,  and  if  these  factors  are  not  attended  to  with  equal vigor, our national aspirations will be thwarted. This  brief  details  six  OSFs  common  among  the  poor  that  significantly  affect  the health and learning opportunities of children, and accordingly limit what schools can  accomplish on  their  own:  (1)  low  birth-weight  and  non-genetic  prenatal influences  on  children;  (2)  inadequate  medical,  dental,  and  vision  care,  often  a result   of   inadequate   or   no   medical   insurance;   (3)   food   insecurity;   (4) environmental   pollutants;   (5)   family   relations   and family   stress;   and   (6) neighborhood characteristics. These OSFs are related to a host of poverty-induced physical,  sociological,  and  psychological  problems that  children  often  bring  to school,  ranging  from  neurological  damage  and  attention  disorders  to  excessive absenteeism, linguistic underdevelopment, and oppositional behavior. Also  discussed  is  a  seventh  OSF,  extended  learning opportunities,  such  as  pre-school, after school, and summer school programs that can help to mitigate some of the harm caused by the first six factors.},

  abstract = {The Scylla and Charybdis in this discussion of teacher evaluation are standardized achievement test data on the one hand, and classroom observational systems on the other. These are the two most common methods used to judge teachers’ competency.~ Both have serious flaws: the former primarily with validity, the latter primarily with reliability. At most these evaluation strategies provide teachers’ and their supervisors information about which to converse. But these two methods have such serious flaws that they should never be used as the primary grounds for rewarding, punishing, or firing teachers.~ When both methods of evaluation are used to judge teacher competency, the correlation between achievement tests and observational data is quite low. When two methods claiming to assess the same construct do not correlate well, either one or both methods are failing to assess the intended construct.~ There are two alternatives for navigating between Scylla and Charybdis: “Duties Based Teacher Evaluation” and “Performance Measures.”~ These methods have much to recommend them, though like all methods of personnel evaluation, reliability and validity issues remain problematic.},

  abstract = {A meta-analysis is performed of the literature on charter schools and achievement, with a focus on lottery-based studies and rigorous value-added studies. Overall, for the limited set of charter schools, locations, and years that have been studied to date, charter schools are producing higher achievement gains in math relative to traditional public schools in most grade groupings. No significant differences emerge for reading achievement. However for both math and reading, the bulk of estimates are positive. For math, middle school studies tend to produce higher effect sizes than other grade groupings. For math, studies that use lotteries or propensity score matching tend to find higher effects than other methods. There is not a statistically significant link between the years covered by a study and the estimated effect size, but for both math and reading the trend is positive. A tiny but growing literature on nonachievement outcomes suggests positive influences of charter schools on educational attainment and behavioral outcomes.},

  abstract = {One issue in school restructuring has been deciding exactly hew to make schools more autonomous and accountable. Charter schools, a recent concept, offer a viable means of integrating various reform ideas in order to create highly autonomous and accountable learning environments. This publication defines charter schools; highlights the appeal of such schools; offers nine elements of "stronger" legislation; and classifies existing laws into two broad categories--those granting more autonomy and those granting less autonomy--as a way to distinguish those laws that appear to hold the most promise of success. Six states have passed legislation granting more autonomy to charter schools--Arizona, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, California, and Colorado. Those granting less autonomy are Hawaii, Georgia, Kansas, New Mexico, and Wisconsin. Each state's legislation is briefly described. The passage of stronger charter school legislation (e.g., legal and fiscal autonomy, super waivers, and school-level negotiation/bargaining provisions) is a difficult process. It is important to clarify key concepts and technology early in the process. Two tables that compare the 10 states' charter school laws are included. (LMI)},

First, operating two systems of public schools under separate governance arrangements can create excess costs. Second, charter school financing policies can distribute resources to or away from districts. Using the city school districts of Albany and Buffalo in New York, we demonstrate how fiscal impacts on local school districts can be estimated. We find that charter schools have had fiscal impacts on these two school districts. Finally, we argue that charter schools policies should seek to minimize any avoidable excess costs created by charter schools and ensure that the burden of any unavoidable excess costs is equitably distributed across traditional public schools, charter schools, and the state. We offer concrete policy recommendations that may help to achieve these objectives.},

  abstract = {"The Rule of Law" is a phrase much used but little examined. The idea of the rule of law as the foundation of modern states and civilizations has recently become even more talismanic than that of democracy, but what does it actually consist of? In this brilliant short book, Britain's former senior law lord, and one of the world's most acute legal minds, examines what the idea actually means. He makes clear that the rule of law is not an arid legal doctrine but is the foundation of a fair and just society, is a guarantee of responsible government, is an important contribution to economic growth and offers the best means yet devised for securing peace and co-operation. He briefly examines the historical origins of the rule, and then advances eight conditions which capture its essence as understood in western democracies today. He also discusses the strains imposed on the rule of law by the threat and experience of international terrorism. The book will be influential in many different fields and should become a key text for anyone interested in politics, society, and the state of our world.},

  abstract = {Parents, policymakers, and educators are committed to identifying great schools and calling attention to failing ones, but they often lack the tools to distinguish adequately between the two. The proliferation of available student data, advancements in analytic methods, and increased public demand for school quality information has spurred innovation and diversification in school quality rating systems. But with this rapid evolution comes the challenge to understand and track these diverse systems’ characteristics. This report conducts an inventory of state and district school rating systems, as well as independent rating systems from charter and education reform organizations. Specifically, we seek to answer: n n What are the primary characteristics of school quality rating systems across the spectrum of rating systems and organizations? n n What are the key trends in the design and implementation of school quality rating systems? n n What challenges exist in developing accountability systems that are applicable across states? These are especially relevant questions for the public charter school sector, with its explicit intention to provide innovative, autonomous schools that are held accountable to rigorous and meaningful quality measures. The increasing sophistication of state accountability systems and frameworks that charter school authorizers use to evaluate charter school quality is providing the public with better information to evaluate and influence the growth of a high-quality charter school sector. However, it remains difficult to compare charter school quality across states. There does not yet exist a robust, national rating system on charter school quality, and several challenges inhibit establishing such a system—most significantly, the lack of comparability across state assessments, and the inability to collect student-level data across states for growth measures. A national system could offer the primary advantage of providing a consistent and comprehensive measure of charter school quality to inform parent choice and authorizer decisions. States and charter authorizers that have not yet established robust school quality rating systems to use in charter school accountability especially need a national system. Although the National Association of Charter School Authorizers (NACSA) 1 and the Building Charter School Quality project 2 have published recommendations for evaluating charter school quality, no national system evaluates charter schools, or traditional schools, with a consistent set of metrics across states. While this report does not attempt to recommend a national charter school quality rating system, the analysis of existing systems can provide useful insights into school quality measures, methods, and reporting formats that should be considered in a national system.},

The findings from the report have shaped the field of education, national education policies, and wider public and scholarly opinion regarding the contributions of schools and schooling to equality and productivity in the United States. Despite past reanalyses of the data and decades of research on the effects of schools as organizations, the report's fundamental finding—that a student's family background is far more important than school social composition and school resources for understanding student outcomes—still retains much of its currency. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Using the original Equality of Educational Opportunity data, this study replicated Coleman's statistical models but also applied a two-level hierarchical linear model (HLM) to measure the effects of school-level social composition, resources, teacher characteristics, and peer characteristics on ninth-grade students’ verbal achievement.                                         Research Design               HLM allows researchers to disentangle how schools and students’ family backgrounds contribute to learning outcomes. The methodology offers a clearer interpretation of the relative effects of school characteristics, including racial/ethnic composition, and family background, including race/ethnicity and social class, on students’ academic outcomes.

Even after statistically taking into account students’ family background, a large proportion of the variation among true school means is related to differences explained by school characteristics. Within-school inequalities in the achievement outcomes for African American and White students and students from families of higher and lower social class are explained in part by teachers’ biases favoring middle-class students and by schools’ greater reliance on curriculum differentiation through the use of academic and nonacademic tracking.                                         Conclusions/Recommendations               Formal decomposition of the variance attributable to individual background and the social composition of the schools suggests that going to a high-poverty school or a highly segregated African American school has a profound effect on a student's achievement outcomes, above and beyond the effect of individual poverty or minority status.

  abstract = {The Coleman Report has inspired various lines of inquiry offering new understandings of inequality of educational opportunity and the persistent achievement gaps in American schools. Of the various models and theories, stereotype threat, which focuses on social-­psychological dimensions of inequality, has received considerable attention over the past twenty years. But what if stereotype threat theory, and associated interventions to combat it, had existed fifty years ago? Using data from the original Equality of Educational Opportunity Study, we find, consistent with the stereotype threat literature, that African American students confronted with more threatening educational contexts are burdened by a less favorable self-­image; this finding partially explains how students’ internalization of racial stereotypes depresses their test scores. Based on these findings and on results from numerous laboratory and field experiments documenting the impact of stereotype threat and how to mitigate it, we explore its usefulness for studying educational inequality in the years to come.},

Many theories of value imply that even relatively small reductions in net existential risk have enormous expected value. Despite their importance, issues surrounding human-extinction risks and related hazards remain poorly understood. In this article, I clarify the concept of existential risk and develop an improved classification scheme. I discuss the relation between existential risks and basic issues in axiology, and show how existential risk reduction (via the maxipok rule) can serve as a strongly action-guiding principle for utilitarian concerns. I also show how the notion of existential risk suggests a new way of thinking about the ideal of sustainability.},

  abstract = {There is growing evidence that out-of-school factors, such as physical and mental health, family support, and social and emotional development, significantly affect student learning (Berliner 2009). To address challenges related to poverty, schools are being charged with serving as a focal point in providing and coordinating support services for students and their families (Adelman and Taylor 2002; Dryfoos 2002). In many schools these support services are provided in fragmented ways that do not address the needs of all students or engage teachers in connecting these services to the academic mission of the school (Walsh and DePaul 2008). An emerging school-based model, broadly termed “comprehensive student support” (Walsh et al. 2016), is designed to overcome such fragmentation. In this paper, we build upon previous effectiveness work with an economic evaluation of a successful support model, City Connects. We find that the benefits of the program exceed the costs, indicating that the program is a sound investment and should be considered an option to address the needs of students and to prevent future crises from disrupting their learning.},

In her research, Brooks found that the “AAG” (pseudonym) network re-conceptualized teaching by urging staff to envision their careers in corporate education rather than in classroom teaching. While some employees received a boost up the corporate ladder, others found themselves being pushed out of the organization. Despite AAG’s equity-conscious discourse, administrators emphasized controlling student behavior as a central measure of teaching effectiveness. Brooks develops the concept of creative compliance to describe the most successful teachers’ tactics for adhering to formal policies strategically, bending the rules in order to survive and advance in a workplace fraught with competition and insecurity.},

Using matched sample difference-in-difference identification with students in Louisiana, we find that the effects vary widely by specific type of intervention, school level, and city/policy context. In Baton Rouge high schools, the interventions reduced high school graduation by 11 percentage points, while in New Orleans elementary schools, they apparently improved test scores by more than 0.3 standard deviations. The results tend to be more positive when schools are phased out rather than immediately closed and when students stay in the same school postintervention. The variation in results is predictable. The effects are generally positive when the interventions improve school quality and minimize disruption, and either null or negative otherwise. In other words, the results depend mainly on basic choices of policy, contract design, and enforcement.},

The lack of relevance of these equations and their incorrect application lead us to conclude that Fredrickson and Losada’s claim to have demonstrated the existence of a critical minimum positivity ratio of 2.9013 is entirely unfounded. More generally, we urge future researchers to exercise caution in the use of advanced mathematical tools such as nonlinear dynamics and in particular to verify that the elementary conditions for their valid application have been met.},

  abstract = {To most of us, learning something "the hard way" implies wasted time and effort. Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier. Make It Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners.Memory plays a central role in our ability to carry out complex cognitive tasks, such as applying knowledge to problems never before encountered and drawing inferences from facts already known. New insights into how memory is encoded, consolidated, and later retrieved have led to a better understanding of how we learn. Grappling with the impediments that make learning challenging leads both to more complex mastery and better retention of what was learned.Many common study habits and practice routines turn out to be counterproductive. Underlining and highlighting, rereading, cramming, and single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. More complex and durable learning come from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has set in, and interleaving the practice of one skill or topic with another. Speaking most urgently to students, teachers, trainers, and athletes, Make It Stick will appeal to all those interested in the challenge of lifelong learning and self-improvement.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

  abstract = {When it comes to American education, few policy areas are as misunderstood — or as crucial — as school finance. Over the past several years, a political and empirical consensus has emerged about the importance of equitable and adequate school funding for high quality K-12 education. In other words, the evidence is clear that money does, indeed, matter. Certainly, debates about how education funds should be spent are also important, and money should be spent wisely. But there are few options for improving America’s schools that don't require adequate and sustained investment, particularly for disadvantaged students. And while maintaining efficiency is important, the fact is that districts cannot spend money wisely that they do not have. In this report, we present key findings from the second release of our School Finance Indicators Database (SFID), a public database of sophisticated but user-friendly state school finance measures going back to 1993. This latest version of the SFID includes data up to 2017 (the 2016-17 school year). The database includes approximately 130 variables, but in this report we focus on three key school finance measures: effort, adequacy, and progressivity. As a whole, we feel that these three measures provide a succinct and informative overview of the adequacy and fairness of states' school finance systems. Our indicators are most appropriately interpreted on a state-by-state basis, but in this report we do attempt to present some calculations of national averages and trends in those averages.},

The surveys were administered through the Transforming Education/NewSchools Venture Fund partnership that worked with the NewSchools Invent Cohort, a network of 23 schools across 11 states, to expand the definition of student success. The analytic sample for this study includes more than 3,000 students in grades 4 through 12 at 18 schools surveyed in the 2016-17 school year. Using classical test theory as our conceptual and analytic lens, we conducted tests of internal consistency, item discrimination, omit rates, differential item functioning, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Our findings provide initial evidence of the validity of the survey scores for measuring student perceptions of their SEC and the school CC in the NewSchools Invent schools, suggesting that the surveys are suitable for school and cohort-level decision-making related to students’ social emotional competencies and experiences within the school.},

  abstract = {Since the inception of charter schools over a decade ago, policymakers have wanted to know how charter schools are performing. This is difficult to answer because there is no single charter school approach to educating students. By design, charter schools have innovative and distinctive education philosophies. In this research, we capture some of the uniqueness of charter schools by clustering them into four major categories: charter schools that convert from conventional public schools, charter schools that start from scratch, charter schools that rely primarily on classroom-based instruction, and charter schools that have a significant portion of instruction outside of the classroom. Based on these four distinctions, we find significant differences in performance. These differences suggest that policymakers may want to focus greater resources on certain types of charter schools versus others. © 2005 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

  abstract = {A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families, and policymakers with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This chapter explores the theoretical and empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: (i) classroom use in schools and (ii) home use by students. Theoretically, information and communications technology (ICT) investment and computer-aided instruction (CAI) use by schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies based on randomized control experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in developing countries.},

In Study 1, judges coded comments participants made during experimental and debriefing sessions. Participants who refused to follow the experimenter’s instructions were significantly more likely to express a sense of personal responsibility than those who followed the instructions. Participants who expressed concern for the well-being of the learner exhibited a greater reluctance to continue the procedure than did those not expressing this concern. However, whether participants expressed concern for the learner was not related to whether they ultimately continued the procedure. Study 2 looked at participants' reactions to each of the experimenter’s four prods. The further along the prod sequence the experimenter went, the less likely participants were to continue the procedure. This pattern challenges interpretations of the obedience studies based on the notion that participants were following orders.},

Perhaps most notably, Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as reauthorized by the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), requires states to test all students annually in grades 3 through 8 and once in high school in the areas of reading, mathematics, and science. These assessments are used as key indicators in an accountability system that determines whether schools are making progress with respect to student achievement. To receive Title I funding, states must also participate in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a standards-based national test given at grades 4 and 8. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) requires states to use assessments to identify students with disabilities and track their progress according to individualized learning goals. In addition to assessments required by federal law, elementary and secondary school students generally participate in many other assessments, which range from small-scale classroom assessments to high-stakes exit exams.},

Among other things, social science can provide CRT with data and theoretical frameworks to support key empirical claims. Social psychology and sociology in particular can help to explain how race constructs key aspects of social experience—for example, the role of race in suspicion of African Americans as potentially criminal and the use of excessive force by law enforcement. At the same time, a collaboration between CRT and social science risks undermining CRT critiques of objectivity and neutrality and potentially limits the theory’s ability to combat structural forms of racial inequality. CRT scholars can mitigate these risks by choosing social science methods carefully and by recognizing that social science is only one among several modes of knowledge production.},

  abstract = {The closure of low-performing schools is an essential feature of the charter school model. Our regression discontinuity analysis uses an exogenous source of variation in school closure—an Ohio law that requires charter schools to close if they fail to meet a specific performance standard—to estimate the causal effect of closure on student achievement. The results indicate that closing low-performing charter schools eventually yields achievement gains of around 0.2–0.3 standard deviations in reading and math for students attending these schools at the time they were identified for closure. The study also employs mandatory closure as an instrument for estimating the impact of exiting low-quality charter schools, thus providing plausible lower-bound estimates of charter school effectiveness. These results complement the more common lottery-based estimates of charter school effects, which likely serve as upper-bound estimates due to their focus on oversubscribed schools often located in cities with high-performing charter sectors. We discuss the implications for research and policy.},

Many factors play a role in shaping how teachers form expectations of students and how students form expectations of themselves and their potential. Further, research has examined how such expectations should be framed and communicated in order to maximize achievement and drive each student, no matter the caliber of his or her starting point, to achieve beyond where he or she began. This brief report highlights the role that expectations play in student learning, achievement, and goal-setting, with an emphasis on the work of John Hattie and Carol Dweck. Where relevant, we incorporate aspects of the Springfield Public Schools Learning Model and note where its principles are reinforced by the findings of Hattie and Dweck’s research on student expectations, fostering mindsets for growth and achievement, and the outcomes of such work.},

Several contextual factors should be considered, however, before we make strong conclusions about the strength of the effect of racial and ethnic minority students attending school with white students. This paper makes a case for considering the necessity of both the “material” and “sociocultural” domains of schooling if we are to move toward a more holistic understanding of “school effects” on students’ academic well-b­ eing. Based on a case-­study analysis of four high-­performing, diverse schools in different regions, using ethnographic observations and random student surveys, this paper offers evidence that students who hail from similar socioeconomic and family backgrounds but who attend schools with different sociocultural contexts have disparate academic experiences. The findings draw our attention to new directions to consider as we seek to understand how educational outcomes vary depending on the school's organizational culture.},

We then elucidate ten problems that novice scholars have with theoretical/conceptual framing, using our own experiences as manuscript reviewers and writers as examples. The paper concludes with ways that novice scholars can address the task of framing their scholarly work conceptually and theoretically, on the understanding that the struggles continue over the lifetime of a scholarly career.},

  abstract = {The most terrible and lasting effects of the coronavirus pandemic will of course be measured in loss of life. But a parallel tragedy will also be unfolding in the coming months and years, this one affecting those at the beginning of their lives: an unprecedented school funding crisis that threatens to disadvantage a generation of children. It currently is difficult to make any precise predictions about the magnitude of the economic recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic, except to say that it has already started and it is likely to be severe. The revenue that funds public K-12 schools—almost 90 percent of which comes from state and local sources—will see large decreases. There will be cuts. Making things worse, school districts in many states have yet to recover from the last recession, the so-called Great Recession, which officially began in late 2007 and devastated state and local education budgets. That is, many jurisdictions will be facing a possibly unprecedented funding crisis while they are still digging out from the last one. Students in the senior class that will graduate this spring started kindergarten in fall 2007. They have spent most of their K-12 careers in schools either facing budget cuts or struggling to recover from them—this means, for example, fewer teachers and support staff, larger classes, and a narrower array of academic and extracurricular programs. The children who begin formal schooling in fall 2020 may be facing the same fate. States and districts, however, are not powerless; there is a path forward. It will not prevent all damage, and it will require forward-thinking policymaking, but it can mitigate the severity and duration of the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on public school funding, as well as make states and districts better prepared for the next crisis. In this report, using data from multiple sources, we describe the effects of previous recessions, particularly the Great Recession, on K-12 education finance, as well as the federal, state, and local policies and trends that mediated—for better or worse—the impact of these downturns on public school budgets. We then use these lessons to offer recommendations for short- and long- term responses to our current crisis.},

  abstract = {The Evaluation of the National Assessment of Educational Progress: Final Report describes the activities of a project that began in 2004. This report is designed to provide information about the evaluation to readers representing a range of stakeholders.  In the final report, we present a practical discussion of the evaluation studies to its primary, intended audience, namely policymakers. In this report, readers will find a foreword prepared by the Technical Work Group for the evaluation that provides a broader context for the findings and recommendations. The Executive Summary then presents a condensed version of the report that can be further explored in the body of the report or in the background study reports that are included on the accompanying CD.  In the first chapter of the final report we discuss the Mandate for the Evaluation that was specified by Congress and the policy context that served as a point of reference for the evaluation. We then describe how this mandate was interpreted through the development of operational questions to guide the evaluation design.  This design is then described in the second chapter of the final report, Our Approach to the Evaluation. Here, we discuss the professional expectations that guided our data collection efforts as well as the limitations of the evaluation design and conclusions. In this chapter we also discuss the Technical Work Group, an external panel of experts in education policy, psychometrics, and evaluation, which provided input on the evaluation design and provided critical reviews of the activities at various points of the project.  Based on the design described earlier, we then discuss the Analysis and Findings in the third chapter of the final report. Within this chapter, findings and recommendations for each of the evaluation questions (e.g., How consistent are NAEP’s procedures with professional testing standards? How consistent are procedures for setting NAEP achievement levels with professional testing standards?) are discussed.   Finally, in the fourth chapter of the final report, Summary and Next Steps, we summarize the results and discuss the findings and recommendations in the context of the legislative mandate and the challenges that policymakers face with a longstanding program like NAEP. Following the text of the report are a series of references and appendixes that include information for readers who desire more information about the report and the sources of evidence that informed it. However, for all readers, we want to highlight Appendix A as a useful resource. Within this appendix is a glossary of acronyms and commonly used terms to help readers become more familiar with some of the organizations, acronyms, and technical terms that are an integral part of understanding NAEP. As additional evidence to support our findings and recommendations, we have included an accompanying CD that contains six study reports. The study reports represent summaries of the data collection, analysis, and findings of the different lines of inquiry that comprised the evaluation design.},

  abstract = {The Cost Estimation Tool for Charter Schools is one in a series of tools created by the National Resource Center on Charter School Finance and Governance (NRC). The NRC created this series to support efforts to ensure successful and sustainable charter schools through effective finance and governance. The NRC designed the Cost Estimation Tool to help start-up charter school operators identify and estimate the range of costs and timing of expenditures they will be obligated to cover during start-up and the early years of operation. The tool provides several worksheets to help charter school operators identify basic cost assumptions (e.g., student enrollment and facilities needs) and use those assumptions to estimate their operating costs. Costs vary widely among charter schools in different states and communities, and these schools serve students of different ages and with different needs. Although the benchmark figures used to calculate costs in this document were obtained through extensive research and vetted by national experts, they are only estimates and may not represent true costs for many charter schools. The contents of this tool were developed under a grant from the U.S. Department of Education (Grant No. U282N060012). However, the contents do not necessarily represent the policy of the department, and endorsement by the federal government should not be assumed.},

  abstract = {Issues regarding race and racial identity as well as questions pertaining to property rights and ownership have been prominent in much public dis- course in the United States. In this article, ProfessorHarris contributes to this discussion by positing that racial identity and property are deeply interrelated concepts. Professor Harris examines how whiteness, initially constructed as a form of racial identity, evolved into a form of property, historically and presently acknowledged and protected in American law. Professor Harris traces the origins of whiteness as property in the parallel systems of domination of Black and Native American peoples out of which were created racially contingent forms of property and property rights. Fol- lowing the period of slavery and conquest, whiteness became the basis of racializedprivilege - a type of status in which white racial identity provided the basisfor allocatingsocietal benefits both private and public in character. These arrangementswere ratified and legitimated in law as a type of status property. Even as legal segregation was overturned, whiteness as property continued to serve as a barrier to effective change as the system of racial classificationoperated to protect entrenched -power. Next, ProfessorHarris examines how the concept of whiteness as property persists in current perceptions of racial identity, in the law's misperception of group identity and in the Court's reasoning and decisions in the arena of affirmative action. ProfessorHarris concludes by arguing that distortions in affirmative action doctrine can only be addressed by confronting and exposing the property interest in whiteness and by acknowledging the distributive justification and function of affirmative action as central to that task. she walked into forbidden worlds impaled on the weapon of her own pale skin she was a sentinel at impromptu planning sessions of her own destruction ....

  abstract = {Unlike most competing texts that are densely written and heavily theoretical, with little flavor of political life, this book is a readable, jargon-free introduction to real-life local politics for today's students. While it encompasses local government and politics in cities and towns across America, "Local Politics: A Practical Guide to Governing at the Grassroots" gives special attention to the politics of suburbia, where many students live, and encourages them to become engaged in their own communities. The book is also distinguished by its strong emphasis on nuts-and-bolts practical politics. It provides focused discussion of institutions, roles, and personalities as well as the dynamic environment of local politics (demographics, immigration, globalization, etc.) and major policy issues (budgets, land use, transportation, education, etc.). Other texts treat communities as abstractions and readers as passive observers. "Local Politics: A Practical Guide to Governing at the Grassroots" is designed to inspire civic engagement as well as understanding. It features "In Your Community" research projects for students in every chapter along with informative tables, clear charts, essential terms, and guides to useful websites.},

We find that public and private schools are distinctively different in environment and organization. Most importantly, private schools are more likely to possess the characteristics widely believed to produce effectiveness. We argue throughout that the differences across the sectors are anchored in the logic of politics and markets. This argument derives from our belief that environmental context has pervasive consequences for the organization and operation of all schools and specifically that the key differences between public and private environments—and thus between public and private schools—derive from their characteristic methods of social control: the public schools are subordinates in a hierarchic system of democratic politics, whereas private schools are largely autonomous actors “controlled” by the market.},

Not only large, established public charter school management organizations (CMOs) with substantial financial resources need apply, but also relatively small, even start-up, public charter schools with limited credit history may be financeable under certain circumstances. The main purpose of this booklet is to provide public charter schools and their stakeholders relevant information about the benefits of tax-exempt financing, including: •Who qualifies for tax-exempt financing •What types of projects qualify for tax-exempt financing •How to decide if tax-exempt financing might be right for your school •Some insights, based on years of experience about best practices and what to expect from financing participants and the overall process The booklet starts by asking the basic question, “Why use tax-exempt bonds?” From there, attorneys from the leading bond counsel firm in the country2 will explore the nuts and bolts of uses of proceeds, structuring considerations, including considerations of ownership versus leasing of facilities, financing for networks, market disclosure, financing milestones, and what to expect after the bonds are issued and the project is underway.},

  abstract = {This paper updates estimates of fossil fuel subsidies, defined as fuel consumption times the gap between existing and efficient prices (i.e., prices warranted by supply costs, environmental costs, and revenue considerations), for 191 countries. Globally, subsidies remained large at \$4.7 trillion (6.3 percent of global GDP) in 2015 and are projected at \$5.2 trillion (6.5 percent of GDP) in 2017. The largest subsidizers in 2015 were China (\$1.4 trillion), United States (\$649 billion), Russia (\$551 billion), European Union (\$289 billion), and India (\$209 billion). About three quarters of global subsidies are due to domestic factors—energy pricing reform thus remains largely in countries’ own national interest—while coal and petroleum together account for 85 percent of global subsidies. Efficient fossil fuel pricing in 2015 would have lowered global carbon emissions by 28 percent and fossil fuel air pollution deaths by 46 percent, and increased government revenue by 3.8 percent of GDP.},

  abstract = {Teachers’ social networks can play an important role in teacher learning and organizational change. But what influences teachers’ networks? Why do some teachers have networks that are likely to support individual and organizational change, while others do not? This study is a first step in answering this question. We focus on how district policy influences the quality and configuration of teachers’ social networks. We draw on a longitudinal, qualitative study of implementation of a mathematics curriculum in four schools. We show that district policy (1) shaped the tie formation process, influencing the structure of networks; (2) mobilized resources that teachers subsequently accessed via their networks, influencing the benefits accrued through network exchanges; and (3) introduced interaction routines that interrupted conventional ways that teachers talked together. We thus uncover heretofore unexplored facets of network formation and change. We also provide insight into dimensions of social networks that are amenable to outside intervention.},

  abstract = {America’s leading defender of the public interest and a bestselling historian show us how to prevent the private takeover of our cherished public resources “An essential read for those who want to fight the assault on public goods and the commons.” —Naomi Klein As people reach for social justice and better lives, they create public goods—free education, public health, open parks, clean water, and many others—that must be kept out of the market. When private interests take over, they strip public goods of their power to lift people up, creating instead a tool to diminish democracy, further inequality, and separate us from each other. The Privatization of Everything, by the founder of In the Public Interest, an organization dedicated to shared prosperity and the common good, chronicles the efforts to turn our public goods into private profit centers. Ever since Ronald Reagan labeled government a dangerous threat, privatization has touched every aspect of our lives, from water and trash collection to the justice system and the military. However, citizens can, and are, wresting back what is ours. A Montana city took back its water infrastructure after finding that they could do it better and cheaper. Colorado towns fought back well-funded campaigns to preserve telecom monopolies and hamstring public broadband. A motivated lawyer fought all the way to the Supreme Court after the State of Georgia erected privatized paywalls around its legal code. The Privatization of Everything connects the dots across a broad spectrum of issues and raises larger questions about who controls the public things we all rely on, exposing the hidden crisis of privatization that has been slowly unfolding over the last fifty years and giving us a road map for taking our country back.},

  abstract = {Given state cuts to US public education, overcrowding and underfunding in urban district schools continue to grow. Yet, how parents understand the role of state disinvestment on underfunded and overcrowded public schools remains relatively unexamined. Drawing from an ethnographic study of school choice in Arizona, I explore how a group of white parents from diverse income and educational levels, who exited their child from a district school to enroll in a charter school, articulated state disinvestment in their everyday lives. Findings show that parents blamed local schools for what were largely the effects of state disinvestment. In particular, parents connected underfunding and overcrowding with a lack of district responsiveness to individual concerns to express the view that dire conditions were a personal and not a collective problem. Concurrent with the view that they were ‘were forced to choose’ a charter school due to a lack of district responsiveness, parents developed the belief that choice makes education more equal, especially for students who don’t ‘fit in’ to the district school. In total, findings highlight how technologies of choice enter into local cultural and material struggles to transform the relationship between parents and schools from a social to an economic one.},

  abstract = {Misinformation can have significant societal consequences. For example, misinformation about climate change has confused the public and stalled support for mitigation policies. When people lack the expertise and skill to evaluate the science behind a claim, they typically rely on heuristics such as substituting judgment about something complex (i.e. climate science) with judgment about something simple (i.e. the character of people who speak about climate science) and are therefore vulnerable to misleading information. Inoculation theory offers one approach to effectively neutralize the influence of misinformation. Typically, inoculations convey resistance by providing people with information that counters misinformation. In contrast, we propose inoculating against misinformation by explaining the fallacious reasoning within misleading denialist claims. We offer a strategy based on critical thinking methods to analyse and detect poor reasoning within denialist claims. This strategy includes detailing argument structure, determining the truth of the premises, and checking for validity, hidden premises, or ambiguous language. Focusing on argument structure also facilitates the identification of reasoning fallacies by locating them in the reasoning process. Because this reason-based form of inoculation is based on general critical thinking methods, it offers the distinct advantage of being accessible to those who lack expertise in climate science. We applied this approach to 42 common denialist claims and find that they all demonstrate fallacious reasoning and fail to refute the scientific consensus regarding anthropogenic global warming. This comprehensive deconstruction and refutation of the most common denialist claims about climate change is designed to act as a resource for communicators and educators who teach climate science and/or critical thinking.},

  abstract = {Emacs Lisp (Elisp) is the Lisp dialect used by the Emacs text editor family. GNU Emacs can currently execute Elisp code either interpreted or byte-interpreted after it has been compiled to byte-code. In this work we discuss the implementation of an optimizing compiler approach for Elisp targeting native code. The native compiler employs the byte-compiler’s internal representation as input and exploits libgccjit to achieve code generation using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) infrastructure. Generated executables are stored as binary files and can be loaded and unloaded dynamically. Most of the functionality of the compiler is written in Elisp itself, including several optimization passes, paired with a C back-end to interface with the GNU Emacs core and libgccjit. Though still a work in progress, our implementation is able to bootstrap a functional Emacs and compile all lexically scoped Elisp files, including the whole GNU Emacs Lisp Package Archive (ELPA) [6]. Nativecompiled Elisp shows an increase of performance ranging from 2.3x up to 42x with respect to the equivalent byte-code, measured over a set of small benchmarks.},

  abstract = {This report presents selected findings from the FY 16 and FY 17 SLFS collections. The selected findings are organized under four primary findings assessing the completeness, comparability, and utility of SLFS data. The first primary finding discusses reporting coverage, providing statistics on the ability of the participating states to report school-level expenditures through the SLFS. The second primary finding uses median and interquartile range (IQR) expenditure statistics derived from the SLFS to show how the data collection can be used as a tool to assess the variability of school-level expenditure data within states and across school districts. The third primary finding analyzes schools reported on the SLFS by charter school status and urbanicity to show how the SLFS can be used as a tool to evaluate school-level expenditures by nonfiscal descriptive characteristics. And the final primary finding uses NCES Title I eligibility and school neighborhood income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) indicators to demonstrate ways school-level expenditure data collected though the SLFS can be evaluated and compared by school poverty level. The findings discussed within this report are intended to broadly demonstrate the range of information and analysis available when using SLFS data. School-level finance reporting is still a relatively new method of reporting for many states; much of the expenditure detail collected through the SLFS—and ultimately presented in this report—is exploratory in nature. But these findings serve to provide examples of the potential utility of the SLFS and the types of analyses that can be conducted using the data collection.},

The current, most prominent NAEP measure of student SES, National School Lunch Program (NSLP) eligibility, has become less valid over time. The panel’s main focus was on the theoretical foundations of SES. O B J EC T I V E S Several objectives guided the panel’s recommendations: • • provide a definition of SES, • • identify components of SES, • • review data collection and measurement approaches, • • create an SES composite, and • • consider implications of a new measure of SES.},

The value of the case study approach is well recognised in the fields of business, law and policy, but somewhat less so in health services research. Based on our experiences of conducting several health-related case studies, we reflect on the different types of case study design, the specific research questions this approach can help answer, the data sources that tend to be used, and the particular advantages and disadvantages of employing this methodological approach. The paper concludes with key pointers to aid those designing and appraising proposals for conducting case study research, and a checklist to help readers assess the quality of case study reports.},

Situating the review in a developmental systems framework, we synthesize evidence from the learning sciences and several branches of educational research regarding well-vetted strategies that support the kinds of relationships and learning opportunities needed to promote children’s well-being, healthy development, and transferable learning. In addition, we review research regarding practices that can help educators respond to individual variability, address adversity, and support resilience, such that schools can enable all children to find positive pathways to adulthood.},

  abstract = {In the current fiscally constrained environment, there is a consensus that traditional public school reform has not worked and funding for it cannot continue unabated. With the spotlight thus shining ever brighter on charter schools as a school reform effort, reaching actionable conclusions about charters has become essential. However, media coverage of charter schools is often polarized rather than productive, and data can be found to support both sides of the debate. This is largely because the literature on charter school effectiveness, until recently, was dominated by single-location studies that each used a slightly different research approach. The CREDO study, “Multiple Choice: Charter School Performance in 16 States,” was among the first studies to attempt a broader picture of overall charter school effectiveness, and it used a novel quasi-experimental method called virtual control records (VCRs).},

Specifically, exposure to the MPCP is associated with a reduction of around 53 percent in drug convictions, 86 percent in property damage convictions, and 38 percent in paternity suits. The program effects tend to be largest for males and students with lower levels of academic achievement at baseline.},

The Digest has been issued annually except for combined editions for the years 1977–78, 1983–84, and 1985–86. Its primary purpose is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American educa- tion from prekindergarten through graduate school. The Digest includes a selection of data from many sources, both government and private, and draws especially on the results of surveys and activities carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). To qualify for inclusion in the Digest, material must be nationwide in scope and of current interest and value. The publication contains information on a variety of subjects in the field of education statistics, including the number of schools and colleges, teachers, enrollments, and graduates, in addition to data on educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, libraries, and international comparisons. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provides back- ground for evaluating education data. Although the Digest contains important information on federal education funding, more detailed information on federal activities is available from federal education program offices.},

  abstract = {We examine 2,190 SEC Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs) issued between 1982 and 2005. We obtain a comprehensive sample of firms that are alleged to have misstated their financial statements. We examine the characteristics of misstating firms along five dimensions: accrual quality, financial performance, non-financial measures, off-balance sheet activities, and market-based measures. We compare misstating firms to themselves during non-misstatement years and misstating firms to the broader population of all publicly listed firms. We find that managers appear to be hiding diminishing performance during misstatement years. We find that accruals are high and that misstating firms have a greater proportion of assets with valuations that are more subject to managerial discretion. In addition, the extent of leasing is increasing and there are abnormal reductions in the number of employees. Misstating firms are raising more financing, have higher price-to-fundamental ratios, and have strong prior stock price performance. We develop a model to predict accounting misstatements. The output of this model is a scaled logistic probability that we term the F-Score, where values greater than one suggest a greater likelihood of a misstatement.},

  abstract = {Before the 2020-21 school year, educators, policymakers, and parents confronted the stark and uncertain trade-offs implied by the health, educational, and economic consequences of offering instruction remotely, in person, or through a hybrid of the two. Most public schools in the U.S. chose remote-only instruction and enrollment fell dramatically (i.e., a loss of roughly 1.1 million K-12 students). We examine the impact of these choices on public-school enrollment using unique panel data that combine district-level enrollment trajectories with information on their instructional modes. We find offering remote-only instead of in-person instruction reduced enrollment by 1.1 percentage points (i.e., a 42 percent increase in disenrollment from -2.6 to -3.7 percent). The disenrollment effects of remote instruction are concentrated in kindergarten and, to a lesser extent, elementary schools. We do not find consistent evidence that remote instruction influenced middle or high-school enrollment or that hybrid instruction had an impact.},

Commentators point to education management organizations (EMOs), for-profit organizations which manage or operate a network of charter schools, as examples of private entities supposedly profiting off public education. In this report, we dispel three common myths about charter schools and their funding, spending, and management (see box). We draw upon comprehensive school funding data collected from traditional public schools (TPS) and public charter schools in 18 cities during fiscal year (FY) 2018. In a November 2020 report, Charter School Funding: Inequity Surges in the Cities, we demonstrated that the public charter schools in those 18 cities received on average one-third less funding than their respective TPS.1 Here we drill down deeply into those data to test claims about public charter schools and the myths surrounding them.},

The participants, from Chicago, Philadelphia, Newark, New York, and other cities, brought first-hand experience and years of working directly with impacted communities and families, rather than relying only on limited measures such as standardized test scores to assess impact. The group found some common concerns: uneven academic performance; practices that pushed or kept students out of charter schools; overly harsh discipline policies; funding patterns that destabilized traditional schools; and a lack of representative governance, transparency, and adequate oversight, leading to potential conflicts of interest and instances of fraud and other problems. To better understand how current charter policy and practice have impacted communities and how they might be revised to provide solutions for these concerns the set of standards and recommendations presented in this report is the culmination of this work. This report hopes to provide guidance to state legislatures, charter authorizers, and other bodies tasked with charter school oversight and to provide communities with concrete recommendations to take to policymakers as they continue to press for access, equity, and public accountability.},

  abstract = {Neighborhoods matter for children’s health and development. All children in the United States should live in neighborhoods with access to good schools, healthyfoods, safe parks and playgrounds, clean air, safe housing and living-wage jobs for the adults in their lives. However,far too many children in the U.S. live in neighborhoods that lack these conditions. • Neighborhoods influence the quality of experiences that children have today.  The neighborhoods where children live influence whether they have access to parks and green spaces, the quality of the early education centers they attend and of their teachers and peers in their neighborhood schools. • Neighborhoods influence children’s health and education. Research shows that poor children who live in higher opportunity neighborhoods have lower stress levels than poor children in low-opportunity neighborhoods. A positive neighborhood environment may protect children against the detrimental effects of family poverty. Children in neighborhoods with higher poverty rates tend to have worse educational outcomes, which affect opportunities for living a healthy life. • Neighborhoods influence children’s norms and expectations for the future. Living in a neighborhood where the local schools have higher graduation rates or a large proportion of adults with college degrees sends strong messages that education is valued and attainable. • Neighborhoods influence future outcomes. Neighborhoods shape children during their critical development years and thus affect children’s long-term outcomes. Research shows that the neighborhoods where children grow up influence long-term outcomes such as their health and life expectancy and their income as adults. The Child Opportunity Index (COI) 2.0 quantifies, maps and compares neighborhood opportunity for children across the United States. It is the first national measure of contemporary child opportunity available: it covers all U.S. neighborhoods. It ranks opportunity by measuring a wide range of neighborhood conditions that shape children’s health and development.},

  title = {Do {{Non-School Resources Substitute}} for {{School Resources}}? {{A Review}} of the {{Evidence}}},
  author = {Downes, Thomas},
  pages = {41},
  abstract = {Researchers have shown that the responses to school finance reforms and tax limitations of states, localities, and of private citizens are varied in their type and magnitude. One response that has been discussed but has not been quantified is the substitution of increased public spending on parks and recreation and other services benefiting children when education spending is constrained. The goal of this paper is to determine if, when fiscal constraints are imposed, provision of non-school provided services to children increases. To accomplish this goal, I take a two-pronged approach. First, using data from the Census of Governments from 1972 to 2002, I attempt to determine if, in those states in which constraints have been imposed on education spending, growth in non-school spending has been more rapid, when compared to growth in spending in unconstrained states. While the finance data will enable me to determine if spending trends have been different in states with and without constraints, these data provide little information on the extent to which private sector substitution has occurred. To document cross-state differences in the use of non-school substitutes for school services, I draw upon the 2001 Before- and After-School Programs and Activities Survey. Neither the analysis using these data nor the analysis using the fiscal data produces evidence of substitution in the dimensions considered. Specifically, the estimates of fiscal responses to constraints indicate that K-12 education spending appears to be favored relative to other expenditure categories. Similarly, the estimates of the relationship between the participation in after-school activities and the existence of fiscal constraints provide no evidence of increased participation in after-school activities in states in which fiscal constraints are present.},

  abstract = {Most of us assume that public schools in America are unequal—that the quality of the education varies with the location of the school and that as a result, children learn more in the schools that serve mostly rich, white kids than in the schools serving mostly poor, black kids. But it turns out that this common assumption is misplaced. As Douglas B. Downey shows in How Schools Really Matter, achievement gaps have very little to do with what goes on in our schools. Not only do schools not exacerbate inequality in skills, they actually help to level the playing field. The real sources of achievement gaps are elsewhere. A close look at the testing data in seasonal patterns bears this out. It turns out that achievement gaps in reading skills between high- and low-income children are nearly entirely formed prior to kindergarten, and schools do more to reduce them than increase them. And when gaps do increase, they tend to do so during summers, not during school periods. So why do both liberal and conservative politicians strongly advocate for school reform, arguing that the poor quality of schools serving disadvantaged children is an important contributor to inequality? It’s because discussing the broader social and economic reforms necessary for really reducing inequality has become too challenging and polarizing—it’s just easier to talk about fixing schools. Of course, there are differences that schools can make, and Downey outlines the kinds of reforms that make sense given what we know about inequality outside of schools, including more school exposure, increased standardization, and better and fairer school and teacher measurements. \hspace{0pt} How Schools Really Matter offers a firm rebuke to those who find nothing but fault in our schools, which are doing a much better than job than we give them credit for. It should also be a call to arms for educators and policymakers: the bottom line is that if we are serious about reducing inequality, we are going to have to fight some battles that are bigger than school reform—battles against the social inequality that is reflected within, rather than generated by—our public school system.},

We focus particularly on the predictive role of the parents’ educational level during middle childhood, controlling for other indices of socioeconomic status and children’s IQ, and the mediating roles of negative family interactions, childhood behavior, and late adolescent aspirations. Data come from the Columbia County Longitudinal Study, which began in 1960 when all 856 third graders in a semi-rural county in New York State were interviewed along with their parents; participants were reinterviewed at ages 19, 30, and 48 (Eron et al, 1971; Huesmann et al., 2002). Parents’ educational level when the child was 8 years old significantly predicted educational and occupational success for the child 40 years later. Structural models showed that parental educational level had no direct effects on child educational level or occupational prestige at age 48 but had significant indirect effects that were independent of the other predictor variables’ effects. These indirect effects were mediated through age 19 educational aspirations and age 19 educational level. These results provide strong support for the unique predictive role of parental education on adult outcomes 40 years later and underscore the developmental importance of mediators of parent education effects such as late adolescent achievement and achievement-related aspirations.},

Infographics are one way of presenting complex and dense informational content in a way that supports cognitive processing, learning, and future recognition and recollection. But the power of infographics is that they are a way of delivering the maximum amount of content in the least amount of space while still being precise and clear; because they are visual presentations as opposed to oral or text presentations, they can quickly tell a story, show relationships, and reveal structure. The following paper reports on an exploration of top 20 ‘liked’ infographics on a popular infographic sharing website to better understand what makes an effective infographic in order to better prepare graduate students as consumers and designers of infographics. The paper concludes with recommendations and strategies on how educators might leverage the power of infographics in their classrooms.},

In contrast to previous studies, students were not prepared for the learning strategies, learning content was experimentally controlled, and effects on factual and transfer knowledge were examined. Students' overall recall performance after one week profited from generating questions and testing but not from restudying. When analyzing the effects on both knowledge types separately, traditional analyses revealed that only factual knowledge appeared to benefit from testing. However, additional Bayesian analyses suggested that generating questions and testing similarly benefit factual and transfer knowledge compared with restudying. The generation of questions thus seems to be another powerful learning strategy, yielding similar effects as testing on long-term retention of coherent learning content in educational contexts, and these effects emerge for factual and transfer knowledge.},

  abstract = {Reviewing the literature on critical pedagogy (CP) and democratic education (DE) reveals that very little has been written comparing the two (Knight and Pearl in Urban Rev 32(2):197–226, 2000). After reading the Urban Review article by Knight and Pearl (2000)—the only publication explicitly comparing the two approaches to education—I was intrigued to further compare, contrast, and consider the possibilities of connecting democratic education and critical pedagogy. My review of current literature suggests that the authors may offer some misleading claims about the theory, operation, and potential of CP. This manuscript, therefore, attempts to (a) present counterevidence to the claims of Knight and Pearl (2000) and (b) explore possibilities for cross-pollination between CP and DE. To do this, this manuscript presents various aspects of Knight and Pearl’s conception of DE; lays out the tenets of CP by drawing on the most recent work of its theorists and practitioners; and, lastly, demonstrates not only that the two approaches are more similar than different, but also that possibilities for cross-pollination exist in working towards the formation of democratic and social justice-oriented citizens.},

  abstract = {If you're enrolled in an executive education or MBA program, you've probably encountered a powerful learning tool: the business case. But if you're like many people, you may find interpreting and writing about cases mystifying, challenging, or downright frustrating.That's not surprising: cases are not expository writing and good ones are often nonlinear and even misleading in their presentation and organization. Apply the conventional approach to understanding business cases, and you may waste time (at best) and arrive at faulty understandings (at worst). In The Case Study Handbook, William Ellet presents a potent new approach for analyzing, discussing, and writing about cases. Early chapters show how to classify cases according to the analytical task they require (solving a problem, making a decision, or forming an evaluation) and quickly establish a base of knowledge about a case. Strategies and templates, in addition to several sample Harvard Business School cases, help you apply the author's framework.Later in the book, Ellet shows how to write persuasive case-analytical essays based on the process laid out earlier. Extensive examples of effective and ineffective writing further reinforce your learning. The book also includes a chapter on how to talk about cases more effectively in class. The Case Study Handbook will be an indispensable learning aid for any current or prospective MBA or executive education student.--},

  abstract = {The finding that the preferences of middle-income Americans are ignored when they diverge from the preferences of the rich is one of the most widely accepted and influential conclusions in political science research today. I offer a cautionary note regarding this conclusion. I demonstrate that even on those issues for which the preferences of the wealthy and those in the middle diverge, policy ends up about where we would expect if policymakers represented the middle class and ignored the affluent. This result emerges because even when middle- and high-income groups express different levels of support for a policy (i.e., a preference gap exists), the policies that receive the most (least) support among the middle typically receive the most (least) support among the affluent (i.e., relative policy support is often equivalent). As a result, the opportunity of unequal representation of the “average citizen” is much less than previously thought. The analysis also shows, however, that substantial opportunity exists for unequal representation of strong partisan preferences. Together, these results reinforce the importance of party identification for understanding policy outcomes and who gets represented.},

  abstract = {Segregation academies are private schools in the Southern United States that were founded in the mid-20th century by white parents to avoid having their children attend desegregated public schools. They were founded between 1954, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, and 1976, when the court ruled similarly about private schools. While many of these schools still exist – most with low percentages of minority students even today – they may not legally discriminate against students or prospective students based on any considerations of religion, race or ethnicity that serve to exclude non-white students. The laws that permitted their racially-discriminatory operation, including government subsidies and tax exemption, were invalidated by U.S. Supreme Court decisions. After Runyon v. McCrary (1976), all of these private schools were forced to accept African-American students. As a result, segregation academies changed their admission policies, ceased operations, or merged with other private schools. But most of these schools remain overwhelmingly white institutions, both because of their founding ethos and because tuition fees are a barrier to entry. In communities where many or most white students are sent to these private schools, the percentages of African-American students in tuition-free public schools are correspondingly elevated. For example, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, as of 2010, 92\% of the students at Lee Academy were white, while 92\% of the students at Clarksdale High School were black. The effects of this de facto racial segregation are compounded by the unequal quality of education produced in communities where whites served by former segregation academies seek to minimize tax levies for public schools.},

Policies tell educators to do something, but not how to enact specific laws. This study analyzes data from 347 schools in 21 districts to identify variables that support the enactment of policies for parental engagement. We address research questions on how school and district practices affect the quality of school-b­ ased partnership programs. Our results indicate that a policy on parental involvement may be a good first step, but other factors—principals’ support for family and community engagement and active facilitation of research-b­ ased structures and processes by district leaders—are important for establishing a basic partnership program. These factors promote programs that engage all students’ families. Schools that take these steps have higher percentages of engaged families and report higher rates of average daily attendance among their students.},

  abstract = {Experimental studies rarely consider the shape and nature of the education production function, which is useful for deriving optimal levels of input substitution in increasingly resource constrained environments. Because of the rapid expansion of EdTech as a substitute for traditional learning around the world and against the backdrop of full-scale temporary substitution due to the coronavirus pandemic, we explore the educational production function by using a large randomized controlled trial that varies dosage of computer-assisted learning (CAL) as a substitute for traditional learning. Results show productionis concave in CAL. Moving from zero to a low level of CAL, the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) of CAL for traditional learning is greater than one. Moving from a lower to a higher level of CAL, production remains on the same or a lower isoquant and the MRTS is equal to or less than one. The estimates are consistent with the general form of a Cobb-Douglas production function and imply that a blended approach of CAL and traditional learning is optimal. The findings have direct implications for the rapidly expanding use of educational technology worldwide and its continued substitution for traditional learning.},

  author = {{Eric J. Brunner}},
  date = {2006-10-25},
  pages = {80},
  abstract = {California’s system of school facility finance is best described as a partnership between the state and local school districts. The state provides districts with financial support for new school construction and modernization projects through the School Facility Program (SFP), which was established in 1998. The SFP represented a major change in the way the state financed school facilities and was designed to simplify the overall structure of the state’s schools facilities program and create a more transparent and equitable funding mechanism. Under the program, new school construction projects are funded on a 50/50 state and local matching basis while modernization projects are funded on a 60/40 basis. Although the program has gone through numerous changes since 1998, the basic structure of the SFP is still in place today. Since 1998, voters in California have approved three statewide bond issues to fund the School Facility Program and are scheduled to vote on a fourth this November. The three bond issues that have passed provided K-12 public schools with \$28.1 billion in state funding for school facility needs. If approved by voters in November of this year, Proposition 1D, the Kindergarten-University Public Education Facilities Bond Act of 2006, will provide an additional \$7.3 billion in state funding. Local school districts finance their share of school construction and modernization project costs primarily with revenue raised through local general obligation bond elections. Since 1998, those local bond elections have provided school districts with an additional \$36 billion to finance school facility improvements. This study provides a comprehensive review of California’s system of school facility finance. In so doing, it attempts to answer five broad questions related to the way California finances its school facility needs: (1) How has the level of school facility funding changed over time and how does it compare to the level of funding in other states; (2) How is the level of school facility funding distributed across school districts; (3) What are the primary causes of inequities in school facility funding across districts; (4) Is facility funding reaching those districts with the greatest facility needs; and (5) How do charter schools obtain funding for school facilities and what are the special issues related to charter school facility finance? This report attempts to answer those questions by reviewing the history of school facility finance in California, documenting California’s current system of school facility finance, and examining the level and distribution of school facility funding since 1998},

CanaryTrap associates a honeytoken to a user account and then monitors its unrecognized use via different channels after sharing it with the third-party app. We design and implement CanaryTrap to investigate misuse of data shared with third-party apps on Facebook. Specifically, we share the email address associated with a Facebook account as a honeytoken by installing a third-party app. We then monitor the received emails and use Facebook’s ad transparency tool to detect any unrecognized use of the shared honeytoken. Our deployment of CanaryTrap to monitor 1,024 Facebook apps has uncovered multiple cases of misuse of data shared with third-party apps on Facebook including ransomware, spam, and targeted advertising.},

These indicators will be updated over time to ensure they remain relevant and helpful. Each item listed indicates a lack of function, commitment, or attention to one or more critical elements of an organization’s operations, which may eventually contribute to an LEA’s insolvency. The existence of any one of the indicators increases risk of potential insolvency and the need for assistance from outside agencies. Lack of attention to these indicators will eventually lead to financial insolvency and potentially the discontinuation of the charter school. Identifying issues early is the key to maintaining fiscal health. Diligent multiyear planning will enable a charter school to better understand its financial objectives and strategies to sustain a high level of fiscal efficiency and overall solvency. A charter school should consider discussing the indicators regularly and complete a Fiscal Health Risk Analysis (FHRA) annually to assess its own fiscal health risk and progress over time.},

This book is not intended to be a collection of opinions on the field. Nor is it meant to be a compendium of the top research articles for this past year. It is not a list of what is currently trending in K-12 online and blended schools. And, it is not a list of ‘best pieces’ from leading researchers in the field. Rather, this handbook is a collection of what we currently know about research in the field. There are at least three main goals for completing this work: 1. To continue to strengthen our field by providing clear evidence of what is known and what is yet to be known; 2. To provide an empirical resource for researchers (new and experienced) as well as parents, media, administrators, and policy officials; and 3. To set in motion a yearly close examination of our field.},

  abstract = {Mandates for mask use in public during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, worsened by global shortage of commercial supplies, have led to widespread use of homemade masks and mask alternatives. It is assumed that wearing such masks reduces the likelihood for an infected person to spread the disease, but many of these mask designs have not been tested in practice. We have applied a simple optical measurement method to evaluate the efficacy of masks to reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets during regular speech. We compare a variety of commonly available mask types and observe that some mask types approach the performance of standard surgical masks, while some mask alternatives, such as neck fleece or bandanas, offer very little protection. Our measurement setup is inexpensive and can be built and operated by non-experts, allowing for rapid evaluation of mask performance during speech, sneezing, or coughing.},

We found that students who switched to virtual charter schools experienced large, negative effects on mathematics and English/language arts achievement that persisted over time and that these effects could not be explained by observed teacher or classroom characteristics.},

  pages = {12},
  abstract = {Packrat parsing is a novel technique for implementing parsers in a lazy functional programming language. A packrat parser provides the power and flexibility of top-down parsing with backtracking and unlimited lookahead, but nevertheless guarantees linear parse time. Any language defined by an LL(k) or LR(k) grammar can be recognized by a packrat parser, in addition to many languages that conventional linear-time algorithms do not support. This additional power simplifies the handling of common syntactic idioms such as the widespread but troublesome longest-match rule, enables the use of sophisticated disambiguation strategies such as syntactic and semantic predicates, provides better grammar composition properties, and allows lexical analysis to be integrated seamlessly into parsing. Yet despite its power, packrat parsing shares the same simplicity and elegance as recursive descent parsing; in fact converting a backtracking recursive descent parser into a linear-time packrat parser often involves only a fairly straightforward structural change. This paper describes packrat parsing informally with emphasis on its use in practical applications, and explores its advantages and disadvantages with respect to the more conventional alternatives.},

Here, we present the results of a statewide charter school evaluation using a broad-based student matching evaluation design, and run two additional analyses using the charter application waitlists as robustness checks. Our additional models, which address concerns of self-selection by using only charter applicants as matched comparison students, yield similar effect estimates and thus provide support for the use of matching designs in charter school evaluations.},

  abstract = {The political popularity of charter schools is unmistakable. This article explores the relationship between charter schools and segregation across the country, in 40 states, the District of Columbia, and several dozen metropolitan areas with large enrollments of charter school students in 2007-08. The descriptive analysis of the charter school enrollment is aimed at understanding the enrollment and characteristics of charter school students and the extent to which charter school students are segregated, including how charter school segregation compare to students in traditional public schools.~ This article examines these questions at different levels, aggregating school-level enrollment to explore patterns among metropolitan areas, states, and the nation using three national datasets.~ Our findings suggest that charters currently isolate students by race and class.~This analysis of recent data finds that charter schools are more racially isolated than traditional public schools in virtually every state and large metropolitan area in the nation.~ In some regions, white students are over-represented in charter schools while in other charter schools, minority students have little exposure to white students.~ Data about the extent to which charter schools serve low-income and English learner students is incomplete, but suggest that a substantial share of charter schools may not enroll such students. As charters represent an increasing share of our public schools, they influence the level of segregation experienced by all of our nation’s school children. After two decades, the promise of charter schools to use choice to foster integration and equality in American education has not yet been realized.},

Drawing on critical discursive psychology, positioning theory, and narrative policy analysis, I examine how dyslexia advocacy discourse forms a cohesive, compelling policy narrative. I argue that this narrative can be understood as a conversion narrative, which drives a privatization agenda in which public schools become mandated consumers for a growing dyslexia industry, and in which the nature of instruction for students with reading difficulties is narrowly prescribed.},

We argue that success in college requires not only cognitive ability but also self-regulatory competencies that are better indexed by high school grades. In a national sample of 47,303 students who applied to college for the 2009/2010 academic year, Study 1 affirmed that high school grades out-predicted test scores for 4-year college graduation. In a convenience sample of 1,622 high school seniors in the Class of 2013, Study 2 revealed that the incremental predictive validity of high school grades for college graduation was explained by composite measures of self-regulation, whereas the incremental predictive validity of test scores was explained by composite measures of cognitive ability.},

  abstract = {This report: (1) investigates the declining state ofthe educational system in America, as measured by high school student performance in the United States and other countries; (2) identifies specific problem areas; and (3) offers multiple recommendations for improvement. The five major recommendations arrived at appear,respectively, under the headings: content, standards and expectations, time, teaching, leadership and fiscal support. Recommendations pertaining to content include the strengthening of high school graduation requirements by establishing minimum requirements for each student of: (a) 4 years of English; (b) 3 years of mathematics; (c) 3 years of science; (d) 3 years of social studies; and (e) one-half year of computer science. With regard to standards and expectations, schools, colleges, and universities are encouraged to adopt more rigorous and measurable standards and higher expectations for academic performance and student conduct. Four-year colleges and universities, in particular, are advised to raise their admission requirements. In order to improve time usage, the report advises that more time should be devoted to students learning the"New Basics," which may, in turn, require a longer school day,or a lengthened school year. Seven ways to improve teacher preparation and to make teaching a more rewarding and respected profession are listed. Six implementation guidelines are suggested for improving educational leadership and fiscal support. Appendices contain: (a) charter of the National Commission on Excellence in Education; (b) schedule of the Commission's public events; (c) list of commissioned papers; (d) list of individuals who testified at Commission hearings; (e) list of other presentations to the Commission; and (f) notable programs.},

We show that it is not only implausible that machines will ever exceed human size, but in fact impossible.},

  abstract = {Each of four theoretical traditions in the study of American politics—which can be characterized as theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy, Economic-Elite Domination, and two types of interest-group pluralism, Majoritarian Pluralism and Biased Pluralism—offers different predictions about which sets of actors have how much influence over public policy: average citizens; economic elites; and organized interest groups, mass-based or business-oriented.             A great deal of empirical research speaks to the policy influence of one or another set of actors, but until recently it has not been possible to test these contrasting theoretical predictions against each other within a single statistical model. We report on an effort to do so, using a unique data set that includes measures of the key variables for 1,779 policy issues.             Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence. The results provide substantial support for theories of Economic-Elite Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism, but not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian Pluralism.},

An essential read for understanding some of the egregious abuses of power that dominate today’s news.Former New York Times columnist Anand Giridharadas takes us into the inner sanctums of a new gilded age, where the rich and powerful fight for equality and justice any way they can--except ways that threaten the social order and their position atop it. We see how they rebrand themselves as saviors of the poor; how they lavishly reward "thought leaders" who redefine "change" in winner-friendly ways; and how they constantly seek to do more good, but never less harm. We hear the limousine confessions of a celebrated foundation boss; witness an American president hem and haw about his plutocratic benefactors; and attend a cruise-ship conference where entrepreneurs celebrate their own self-interested magnanimity. Giridharadas asks hard questions: Why, for example, should our gravest problems be solved by the unelected upper crust instead of the public institutions it erodes by lobbying and dodging taxes? He also points toward an answer: Rather than rely on scraps from the winners, we must take on the grueling democratic work of building more robust, egalitarian institutions and truly changing the world. A call to action for elites and everyday citizens alike.},

  abstract = {"We shape our tools and then they shape us." With these words, Kenneth Boulding captured one of the great truths of the modern world. In Fertilizers, Pills, and Magnetic Strips, Gene V Glass analyzes how a few key technological inventions changed culture in America and how public education has changed as a result. Driving these changes are material self-interest and the desire for comfort and security, both of which have transformed American culture into a hyper-consuming, xenophobic society that is systematically degrading public education. Glass shows how the central education policy debates at the start of the 21st century (vouchers, charter schools, tax credits, high-stakes testing, bilingual education) are actually about two underlying issues: how can the costs of public education be cut, and how can the education of the White middle-class be "quasi-privatized" at public expense? Working from the demographic realities of the past thirty years, he projects a challenging and disturbing future for public education in America.},

Prominent elements of KIPP’s educational model include high expectations for student achievement and behavior, and a substantial increase in time in school. KIPP is being watched closely by policy makers and educators as a possible model for urban education, but existing studies of KIPP’s effects on students have been subject to methodological limitations, making them less than conclusive. We measure the achievement impacts of forty-one KIPP middle schools across the country, using propensity-score matching to identify traditional public school students with similar characteristics and prior-achievement histories as students who enter KIPP. We find consistently positive and statistically significant impacts of KIPP on student achievement, with larger impacts in math than reading. These impacts persist over four years following admission, and are not driven by attrition of low performers from KIPP schools.},

  abstract = {In most countries, the government is the main provider of education services. Even when a private education sector exists, it is often subsidized. Given the substantial involvement of governments in the education sector and the importance of skill acquisition for individual and national welfare, understanding how societies allocate public resources for education is a crucial issue. The purpose of this chapter is to review positive models of public funding for education. Models reviewed in this chapter consist of a private layer and a political economy layer. In the private layer, firms and households make their decisions taking as given the public policies. In the political economy layer, voters or groups with conflicting interests determine the public policy, taking into account the private sector response to the policy. The questions addressed by the models in this chapter include: What is the majority preferred level of funding for public education when private options are available? How do various dimensions of household heterogeneity (e.g., income, age, ability, tastes) alter the political equilibrium? What is the level of public funding in each community when households can sort themselves into multiple communities? Why are large-scale vouchers in education so rare across the world? Why are public education expenditures as a fraction of GDP rising along the development path? The focus of this chapter is theory, but calibrated versions of the theory that rely on empirical work are also included. We also review the empirical evidence that has bearing on the theoretical models in this chapter.},

  abstract = {The Fulton Fish Market was a colorful part of the New York City landscape that operated on Fulton Street in Manhattan for over 150 years. In 2005 the market moved from the South Street Seaport in lower Manhattan to Hunts Point in the South Bronx. The Fulton Fish Market—now called The New Fulton Fish Market—is one of the world's largest fish markets, second in size only to Tsukiji, the famous fish market in Tokyo. To economists, it may seem that a large centralized market with well-informed buyers and sellers should also be a very competitive market. But fish is a highly differentiated product. Buyers often wish to examine fish themselves, or have their agents do so. The centralized market performs an important function in matching fish to buyers. The high level of product differentiation and the institutional structure in the Fulton fish market can lead to patterns of behavior that suggest imperfect competition and a segmented market. At times in the past, the repeated nature of price setting and extensive knowledge of the sellers may have created the basis for tacit collusion and allowed the dealers to gather economic rents by exploiting the different elasticities and buying patterns. Additional economic rents resulted from subsidies. Before reforms in 1995, lax regulation of the market provided fertile ground for organized crime.},

  title = {Comparison of {{Principals}}' {{Leadership Practices}} by {{Methods}} of {{Professional Development}}},
  author = {Grande, Marcia J},
  abstract = {Although the roles of instructional leader and lead learner have become central in the work of 21 st century principals, their professional development has garnered little attention. This quantitative, non-experimental, comparative survey study investigated differences in the self-reported leadership behaviors of principals who identified themselves as using either supported or unsupported professional development. Brain based learning, constructivist learning, and adult learning theories, together with professional development standards, created the conceptual framework for this study. Participants were obtained through a purposive national sampling of 7,000 of 230,600 U.S. principals, delimited to leaders in their school for 2 years or more. The voluntary, anonymous online survey yielded 186 usable surveys. The Principals Instructional Management Rating Scale was used to measure leadership behaviors. The t-test of means was used to compare the means of responses from supported and unsupported principals for each leadership domain. Supported principals’ means of responses were higher for Domain 1 (defining the school’s mission). The difference in means, however was not statistically significant when subjected to the Bonferroni correction adjustment for potential family wise errors. Research suggests the strongest link between student achievement and leadership practices is Domain 1 leadership behaviors, thus warranting further investigation of the use of principals’ professional learning communities and trained mentors/coaches. Implications for positive social change include further understanding of the importance of high quality professional development for school leaders to support their work in defining the school’s mission.},

The issues related to higher education are incredibly complex and the Select Committee is intended to be a multi-year endeavor. A thoughtful, deliberative, and long-term approach is necessary. Over a two year period, the Select Committee convened five hearings throughout the state including in the Bay Area, Central Valley, and Southern California. The hearings focused on the following topics: an overview and status of higher education, California’s workforce needs, the needs of students, the needs of faculty and staff, and an overview and status of higher education finance. This report summarizes the testimony from the five hearings and highlights the first two years of the Select Committee’s information gathering phase. The report also includes key findings that originated from testimony as well as policy themes. The findings and policy themes were not voted on by members of the Select Committee. The policy themes instead come from the panelists.},

Also, none of the texts present any coverage of the recent reinterpretation of the study’s findings in terms of engaged followership based on participants’ acceptance of the experimenter’s scientific goals.

In addition to its main series of periodic assessments at grades 4, 8, and 12 in various subject areas (main NAEP), these include the NAEP Long-Term Trend (LTT). The National Assessment Governing Board (Governing Board), created by Congress to formulate policy for NAEP, strives to minimize administrative and testing burdens entailed by NAEP data collections and to realize efficiencies in NAEP operations. Accordingly, the Governing Board's Strategic Vision calls for an examination of policy and technical implications related to the future of NAEP LTT assessments in reading and mathematics. A stakeholder outreach event, to be held early next year, will inform the Governing Board's deliberations as to whether LTT assessments should be continued independently from main NAEP assessments, whether it is feasible to blend LTT assessments with main NAEP assessments, and related questions. This white paper has been commissioned by the Governing Board in preparation for that event. It is intended as both a summary of the history of the LTT and an analysis of some options that the Governing Board and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) may wish to consider.},

  abstract = {Good self-control has been linked to adaptive outcomes such as better health, cohesive personal relationships, success in the workplace and at school, and less susceptibility to crime and addictions. In contrast, self-control failure is linked to maladaptive outcomes. Understanding the mechanisms by which self-control predicts behavior may assist in promoting better regulation and outcomes. A popular approach to understanding self-control is the strength or resource depletion model. Self-control is conceptualized as a limited resource that becomes depleted after a period of exertion resulting in self-control failure. The model has typically been tested using a sequential-task experimental paradigm, in which people completing an initial self-control task have reduced self-control capacity and poorer performance on a subsequent task, a state known as ego depletion. Although a meta-analysis of ego-depletion experiments found a medium-sized effect, subsequent meta-analyses have questioned the size and existence of the effect and identified instances of possible bias. The analyses served as a catalyst for the current Registered Replication Report of the ego-depletion effect. Multiple laboratories ( k = 23, total N = 2,141) conducted replications of a standardized ego-depletion protocol based on a sequential-task paradigm by Sripada et al. Meta-analysis of the studies revealed that the size of the ego-depletion effect was small with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) that encompassed zero ( d = 0.04, 95\% CI [−0.07, 0.15]. We discuss implications of the findings for the ego-depletion effect and the resource depletion model of self-control.},

In an enlightening preface, Hannah-Jones pinpoints the origins of the project in her reading of Lerone Bennet Jr.’s Before the Mayflower as a high school student, and discusses the political and scholarly backlash it’s received. Updated versions of the original 10 essays examine the struggle for African American voting rights and the centrality of Black music to American culture, among other topics, while new essays by Carol Anderson and Leslie and Michelle Alexander spotlight double standards in the application of self-defense laws and the police response to Black Lives Matter protests and the January 6 Capitol riot. Stories and poems by Claudia Rankine, Terry McMillan, Darryl Pinckney, and others bring to vivid life historical moments such as the reading of the Emancipation Proclamation to “one of the first Black military brigades.” The result is a bracing and vital reconsideration of American history.},

  abstract = {Spurred by court rulings requiring states to increase public-school funding, the United States now spends more per student on K-12 education than almost any other country. Yet American students still achieve less than their foreign counterparts, their performance has been flat for decades, millions of them are failing, and poor and minority students remain far behind their more advantaged peers. In this book, Eric Hanushek and Alfred Lindseth trace the history of reform efforts and conclude that the principal focus of both courts and legislatures on ever-increasing funding has done little to improve student achievement. Instead, Hanushek and Lindseth propose a new approach: a performance-based system that directly links funding to success in raising student achievement. This system would empower and motivate educators to make better, more cost-effective decisions about how to run their schools, ultimately leading to improved student performance. Hanushek and Lindseth have been important participants in the school funding debate for three decades. Here, they draw on their experience, as well as the best available research and data, to show why improving schools will require overhauling the way financing, incentives, and accountability work in public education.},

  abstract = {The Coleman Report posited that the inequality of educational opportunity appears to stem from the home itself and the cultural influences immediately surrounding the home. However, this line of inquiry assumes that school and home processes operate in isolation, which is often not the case. An example of how families and schools can reinforce one another is through parental involvement. Whereas some studies suggest that children have better achievement outcomes when their parents are involved in their education, other studies challenge the link between parental involvement and academic outcomes. One major reason for this lack of consensus among scholars is that parents’ involvement has been measured differently across studies. Thus, scholars’ disagreements about how parents should be involved and about which aspects of parental involvement are associated with improvements in children’s academic outcomes have contributed to inconsistent findings. We argue that the mixed results observed in previous studies indicate that parental involvement does not operate through the typical channels posited by researchers, educators, and policymakers and that traditional measures of parental involvement fail to capture the fundamental ways in which parents help their children academically. We propose a framework of parental involvement that might provide some clarity on how parental involvement operates.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique opportunity to examine how local governments respond to a public health crisis amid high levels of partisan polarization and an increasing tendency for local issues to become nationalized. As an arena that has, in recent years, been relatively separate from national partisan divides, public schools provide a useful window into these dynamics. Leveraging the fact that all of the nation’s school districts had to adopt a reopening plan for the fall, we test what factors best predict whether a district chose to return students to the classroom or educate them remotely. Contrary to the conventional understanding of school districts as localized and nonpartisan actors, we find evidence that politics, far more than science, shaped school district decision-making. Mass partisanship and teacher union strength best explain how school boards approached reopening. Additionally, we find evidence that districts are sensitive to the threat of private school exit. Districts located in counties with a larger number of Catholic schools were less likely to shut down and more likely to return to inperson learning. These findings have important implications for our understanding of education policy and the functioning of American local governments.},

The two-part report examines the responses to a short list of questions about facility costs and growth plans, and it explores information provided by a subset of schools (118 institutions) that completed longer survey instruments covering a wider range of questions about schools' facilities experiences and challenges. Among the findings are that the majority of charter schools in the survey lease their facilities, that fewer than one in seven charter schools receive "free" facilities, and that the average cost for facilities is \$191,553 or \$690 per student. The study also found that charter school challenges may become more acute in coming years due to planned growth, that nearly six out of 10 responders indicated plans to expand their facilities, and that the average plan is for an increase in enrollment of 63 percent or higher. The report further details the types of facilities used by charter schools; facility ownership, size, and space sharing; experience of obtaining financing; and the limitations and challenges arising from facilities issues. An appendix contains information on how the data for the report was collected. (GR)},

Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.},

Notwithstanding philanthrocapitalism’s growing significance, relevant scholarly discourse remains limited and fragmented. Drawing together diverse debates, our paper systematically reviews and synthesizes academic literature on philanthrocapitalism. Alongside raising questions about the casting and practice of philanthropy, the 186 relevant publications included in our review indicate a strong emphasis of philanthrocapitalism in the areas of education, international development, healthcare and agriculture. Across these, we identify and discuss the importance of three cultural frames: (1) development challenges being framed as scientific problems; (2) beneficiaries being framed as productive entrepreneurs; and (3) philanthropy being framed as social investment. Outlining and critically examining these issues, this work contributes: a comprehensive analysis of key debates and issues; strengthened conceptual clarity and nuance through an evaluative exploration of the multiple interpretations of philanthrocapitalism; and a future research agenda to address persisting knowledge gaps and refine focus.},

Impacts are especially pronounced for the children of male participants. These treatment effects are associated with improved childhood home environments. The intergenerational effects arise despite the fact that families of treated subjects live in similar or worse neighborhoods than the control families. We also find substantial positive effects of the Perry program on the siblings of participants who did not directly participate in the program, especially for male siblings.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a guide to calculating statistical power for the complex multilevel designs that are used in most field studies in education research. For multilevel evaluation studies in the field of education, it is important to account for the impact of clustering on the standard errors of estimates of treatment effects. Using ideas from survey research, the paper explains how sample design induces random variation in the quantities observed in a randomized experiment, and how this random variation relates to statistical power. The manner in which statistical power depends upon the values of intraclass correlations, sample sizes at the various levels, the standardized average treatment effect (effect size), the multiple correlation between covariates and the outcome at different levels, and the heterogeneity of treatment effects across sampling units is illustrated. Both hierarchical and randomized block designs are considered. The paper demonstrates that statistical power in complex designs involving clustered sampling can be computed simply from standard power tables using the idea of operational effect sizes: effect sizes multiplied by a design effect that depends on features of the complex experimental design. These concepts are applied to provide methods for computing power for each of the research designs most frequently used in education research.},

  abstract = {We conduct descriptive and inferential analyses of publicly available Common Core of Data (CCD) to examine segregation at the local, state, and national levels. Nationally, we find that higher percentages of charter students of every race attend intensely segregated schools. The highest levels of racial isolation are at the primary level for public and middle level for charters. We find that double segregation by race and class is higher in charter schools. Charters are more likely to be segregated, even when controlling for local ethnoracial demographics. A majority of states have at least half of Blacks and a third of Latinx in intensely segregated charters. At the city level, we find that higher percentages of urban charter students were attending intensely segregated schools.},

  abstract = {Objective: This article presents health science educators and researchers with an overview of standardized testing in educational measurement. The history, theoretical frameworks of classical test theory, item response theory (IRT), and the most common IRT models used in modern testing are presented. Methods: A narrative overview of the history, theoretical concepts, test theory, and IRT is provided to familiarize the reader with these concepts of modern testing. Examples of data analyses using different models are shown using 2 simulated data sets. One set consisted of a sample of 2000 item responses to 40 multiple-choice, dichotomously scored items. This set was used to fit 1-parameter logistic (PL) model, 2PL, and 3PL IRT models. Another data set was a sample of 1500 item responses to 10 polytomously scored items. The second data set was used to fit a graded response model. Results: Model-based item parameter estimates for 1PL, 2PL, 3PL, and graded response are presented, evaluated, and explained. Conclusion: This study provides health science educators and education researchers with an introduction to educational measurement. The history of standardized testing, the frameworks of classical test theory and IRT, and the logic of scaling and equating are presented. This introductory article will aid readers in understanding these concepts.},

In this analysis, we examine how two traditional public schools in a ‘‘high pressure/high choice’’ urban school cluster in Texas responded to a number of overlapping choice policies that have caused them to lose significant numbers of students. We explore how these two traditional public schools made sense of, and formulated a response to, their multiple ‘‘competitors,’’ how they balanced market pressures and the other external (accountability) pressures that they faced. In this analysis, we illustrate how competition does not always lead to significant or productive change in low performing schools.},

  abstract = {This book explores the ideological contexts for the creation and spread of “No Excuses” charter schools. In so doing, Work Hard, Be Hard focuses closely on the Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) charter school chain as the most prominent exemplar for total compliance “No Excuses” schooling. By way of in-depth interviews, former teachers offer accounts of their “No Excuses” teaching experiences that have not been heard before and that are not likely to be forgotten soon. Work Hard, Be Hard also examines the KIPP organization as a manifestation of modern education reform exemplified in the convergence of neoliberal politics and the aggressive activities of the business and philanthropic communities. As an important corollary to the total compliance charter phenomenon, the book explores, too, the role of Teach for America in supplying the needed manpower and values components required to deal with very high levels of teacher attrition in these schools. Work Hard, Be Hard goes beyond accounts offered in news features, articles, and interviews that focus on “No Excuses” charters’ high test scores and expanded college opportunities for economically disadvantaged children. In short, the book offers a naturalistic antidote to the high profile gloss that mass media provides for “No Excuses” schooling. Work Hard, Be Hard examines new developments in “No Excuses” schooling that focus on psychological interventions aimed to alter children’s neurological and behavioral schemas in order to affect socio-cultural values and behaviors. Fraught with potential for abuse and misapplication by minimally trained teachers, these cult-like practices are examined and contrasted with more humane strategies that hope to reawaken the virtues of teaching and learning within the expansive confines of the sciences and arts of a truly humane pedagogy.},

In The Book, Keith Houston reveals that the paper, ink, thread, glue, and board from which a book is made tell as rich a story as the words on its pages—of civilizations, empires, human ingenuity, and madness. In an invitingly tactile history of this 2,000-year-old medium, Houston follows the development of writing, printing, the art of illustrations, and binding to show how we have moved from cuneiform tablets and papyrus scrolls to the hardcovers and paperbacks of today. Sure to delight book lovers of all stripes with its lush, full-color illustrations, The Book gives us the momentous and surprising history behind humanity’s most important—and universal—information technology.},

Davis characterized American public opinion in the Reagan era as “conservative weather” amidst a liberalizing “climate.” By climate, he meant differences between cohorts, while the weather referred to trends within cohorts. Thirty years later, the public opinion climate continues to get more liberal, as each successive cohort continues to be more liberal, on balance, than the ones that came before them. Recent weather complements that by being quite liberal, too. Specifically, 62 percent of variables analyzed were more liberal in recent birth cohorts than they were in the oldest ones, but just 5 percent were more conservative (some did not differ among cohorts, and some were neither liberal nor conservative). Within cohorts, recent measurements were more liberal than early measurements for 51 percent of the variables and more conservative for 11 percent},

  abstract = {I consider how online postsecondary education, including massive open online courses (MOOCs), might fit into economically sustainable models of postsecondary education. I contrast nonselective postsecondary education (NSPE) in which institutions sell fairly standardized educational services in return for upfront payments and highly selective postsecondary education (HSPE) in which institutions invest in students in return for repayments much later in life. The analysis suggests that MOOCs will be financially sustainable substitutes for some NSPE, but there are risks even in these situations. The analysis suggests that MOOCs will be financially sustainable substitutes for only a small share of HSPE and are likely to collapse the economic model that allows HSPE institutions to invest in advanced education and research. I outline a non-MOOC model of online education that may allow HSPE institutions both to sustain their distinctive activities and to reach a larger number of students.},

  abstract = {A modern gold rush continues to sweep California. Charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated, have increased in number by more than 900 percent in the past two decades to over 1,200 schools today, the most in the nation. Charter school funding, including local, state, and federal expenditures, now tops \$6 billion annually—this is on top of the hundreds of millions of public dollars and publicly subsidized funds the state's charter schools receive each year to lease, build, or buy school buildings. Despite this substantial investment, governments at all levels are unable to proactively monitor the private groups that operate charter schools for fraud and waste. Most public school districts aren't given adequate resources to oversee operators, especially large charter management organizations (CMOs), while all lack the statutory authority to effectively monitor and hold charter schools accountable. This report builds on existing research to show that, due to this lack of oversight, an untold amount of public funding is being lost. Only the tip of the iceberg is visible, but this much is known: total alleged and confirmed fraud and waste in California's charter schools has reached over \$149 million.},

However, the empirical literature testing this assumption yields mixed findings. This systematic review and meta-analysis tests this theory by synthesizing the empirical literature on the competitive effects of school choice on student achievement. Overall, we found small positive effects of competition on student achievement. We also found some evidence that the type of school-choice policy and student demographics moderated the effects of competition on student achievement. By examining whether school competition improves outcomes, our findings can inform decisions of state and local policymakers who have adopted or are considering adopting school-choice reforms.},

  abstract = {In an age of increasing technology, the possibility that typing on a keyboard will replace handwriting raises questions about the future usefulness of handwriting skills. Here we present evidence that brain activation during letter perception is influenced in different, important ways by previous handwriting of letters versus previous typing or tracing of those same letters. Preliterate, five-year old children printed, typed, or traced letters and shapes, then were shown images of these stimuli while undergoing functional MRI scanning. A previously documented ‘‘reading circuit’’ was recruited during letter perception only after handwriting—not after typing or tracing experience. These findings demonstrate that handwriting is important for the early recruitment in letter processing of brain regions known to underlie successful reading. Handwriting therefore may facilitate reading acquisition in young children. Published by Elsevier GmbH.},

Using panel data on students from a large urban school district, we estimate the impact of accountability pressure related to the No Child Left Behind Act on two measures of academic achievement: the state test and an “audit” test that is not tied to the accountability system. Overall, we find that accountability pressure is associated with increased state test scores in math and lower audit math and reading test scores. However, the sources of state and audit test score divergence varied by students’ race. Black students in schools facing the most accountability pressure made no gains on state tests, and their losses on audit math tests were twice as large as those of Hispanic students. These findings highlight the importance of better understanding the mechanisms that produce heterogeneous effects of accountability pressure across achievement measures and subgroups.},

  abstract = {Coronavirus has put the future of K-12 public education in question. School districts, teachers, and staff are mobilizing to provide students with online learning, emotional care, meals, and other support. Meanwhile, online education companies—with the ideological backing of right- wing think tanks—are aiming to further privatize public education and profit off of students. It goes without saying that online education can’t replace the in-person teaching, social interaction, and—for many students—calories that a brick-and-mortar public school provides. However, that isn’t stopping some from arguing that much if not all of K-12 education should stay online after the crisis. In the Public Interest has gathered the following research on online education, revealing a track record of poor academic performance, lack of equity and access, and privacy concerns.},

Implications for future research, the role of self-fulfilling prophecies in social problems, and perspectives emphasizing the power of erroneous beliefs to create social reality are discussed.},

The purpose of this paper is to survey theories and practices in the choice of the social discount rate. More specifically, the paper examines economic arguments for discounting future benefits and costs and analytical approaches to the choice of the social discount rate, including how a social discount rate can be estimated empirically under each approach; and policy practices followed by countries around the world in the choice of the social discount rate. This paper is intended as a reference material on project economic analysis for ADB staff, consultants, and concerned government officials in developing member countries.},

  abstract = {Charter schools are public schools that operate under a contract (or "charter"). The expectation is that these schools meet the terms of their charter or face closure by their authorizing bodies. As public schools, charter schools must also meet the accountability requirements of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). Since 1991 when Minnesota passed the first state charter school law, the charter school sector of public education has grown rapidly. By the 2002-03 school year, 39 states and the District of Columbia had charter school laws in place, and more than 2,700 charter schools were operating nationally, serving hundreds of thousands of students from every socioeconomic and demographic segment of the U.S. population. Federal support for charter schools began in 1995 with the authorization of the Public Charter Schools Program (PCSP), administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). The PCSP funds the state grant program discussed in this report, supports charter school research and demonstration programs and underwrites national charter school conferences. This report has a dual purpose: (1) to provide the public and education policymakers with findings from a descriptive examination of how the PCSP operates and (2) to continue documentation of the evolution of the charter school movement that began in 1995 under another federally funded study.},

  abstract = {Standardized testing is viewed as particularly incompatible to the process of learning due to its summative nature as it measures what students are able to recall and produce. Because of the discrepancy between the process of learning and products of learning, educators today have come to recognize that an alternative form of assessment is required to complement the existing form of assessment. This study intends to determine the techniques ESL teachers use in implementing portfolio as an assessment tool. The techniques ESL teachers employed while implementing the assessment process in the classroom enabled the researchers to propose a model for portfolio assessment. Currently, ESL teachers in Malaysia do not have a specific model or technique to conduct the portfolio assessment process because portfolio is heard of but not widely used. Therefore, this study was carried to scrutinize procedures ESL teachers use as a guide in instructional planning and student evaluation based on their teaching in the L2 classroom. The participants were nine ESL secondary school teachers in Malaysia. Semi-structured interviews, classroom observations and teachers’ individual portfolios were utilized to explore the techniques which served as a guideline for ESL teachers employed for the teaching and learning in the classroom. Findings indicate that the portfolio assessment model developed has provided ESL teachers the opportunity to document individual student’s growth. Furthermore, the teachers divulged that teaching is sustained when teaching materials, teaching techniques and assessment techniques were upgraded to help students in achieving the learning outcomes. The results of the study have implications for assessment, teaching and learning of English as a second language.},

In fact, critical pedagogy, despite its unrelenting assault on the oppressiveness of schooling, may be guilty of diversion, divi- sion, illusion, and confusion, which are the major thrusts of oppression in a “democratic society.” Unlike critical pedagogy, a general theory of education informed by the seven aforementioned attributes of democracy provides multiple avenues for initiation of signif- icant and realistic educational reform in existing public school sites.},

Bringing together analysis of classic works alongside the most recent developments in the field, this book is guided by the following three crucial questions: What is public policy? Who participates in making and putting public policy in practice as well as in assessing its success? And when and how does public policy change over time? In answering these questions, the book covers everything from the central institutions and actors of policy-making to implementation, evaluation and governance. Drawing on examples from across the world, the new edition expands on themes that were previously covered only marginally, including the underexplored connection between public policy and political economy, as well as placing more emphasis on climate change and practical advice on doing policy analysis. For undergraduate or postgraduate students studying on courses focussed on public policy or the policy cycle or process, this textbook is the essential guide to the subject. The book is also suited for those studying public policy in the context of politics or public management and administration. --},

  author = {Knill, Oliver},
  date = {2020},
  abstract = {An expository hitchhikers guide to some theorems in mathematics. Criteria for the current list of 172 theorems are whether the result can be formulated elegantly, whether it is beautiful or useful and whether it could serve as a guide [6] without leading to panic. The order is not a ranking but ordered along a time-line when things were written down. Since [350] stated “a mathematical theorem only becomes beautiful if presented as a crown jewel within a context” we try sometimes to give some context. Of course, any such list of theorems is a matter of personal preferences, taste and limitations. The number of theorems is arbitrary, the initial obvious goal was 42 but that number got eventually surpassed as it is hard to stop, once started. As a compensation, there are 42 “tweetable” theorems with included proofs. More comments on the choice of the theorems is included in an epilogue. For literature on general mathematics, see [132, 128, 23, 156, 167, 393, 267, 95], for history [147, 398, 242, 49, 37, 139, 244, 236, 437, 78, 392, 54, 170, 219], for popular, beautiful or elegant things [9, 332, 135, 123, 14, 425, 426, 35, 136, 129, 162, 285, 390, 195, 135, 2, 86, 102, 87, 317]. For comprehensive overviews in large parts of mathematics, [50, 114, 115, 40, 373] or predictions on developments [38]. For reflections about mathematics in general [101, 290, 36, 197, 283, 70, 354].

This line of research holds much promise in explaining some of the foundational evolutionary origins of basic political orientations. Much of this recent research focused specifically on skin conductance response to threatening and disgusting stimuli, however, is based on analyses of a data collection sample of approximately 200 study participants drawn from the same community at a single point in time. Herein we attempt to reproduce many of the basic findings of recent research on skin conductance response and political behavior using data collected from a novel and unique dataset in a different context. In brief, we fail to reproduce many of the basic findings from this incipient line of research which suggests that the link between skin conductance and political behavior may be more contingent than previously assumed.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the effects of three large, coal-fired power plant closures on student absences and achievement in the Chicago area. We find that schools near the plants experienced a 7 percent reduction in absences relative to those further away following the closures. Math achievement in these schools increased following the closures, although our estimates are imprecise. Using data on wind, air conditioning, and magnet schools, we show that schools with higher baseline pollution exposure experienced the greatest gains from the plant closures. Our analysis of mechanisms suggests that health is an important channel through which air pollution affects absences.},

  abstract = {Following a remarkable epoch of greater dispersion of wealth and opportunity, we are inexorably returning towards a more feudal era marked by greater concentration of wealth and property, reduced upward mobility, demographic stagnation, and increased dogmatism. If the last seventy years saw a massive expansion of the middle class, not only in America but in much of the developed world, today that class is declining and a new, more hierarchical society is emerging. The new class structure resembles that of Medieval times. At the apex of the new order are two classes―a reborn clerical elite, the clerisy, which dominates the upper part of the professional ranks, universities, media and culture, and a new aristocracy led by tech oligarchs with unprecedented wealth and growing control of information. These two classes correspond to the old French First and Second Estates. Below these two classes lies what was once called the Third Estate. This includes the yeomanry, which is made up largely of small businesspeople, minor property owners, skilled workers and private-sector oriented professionals. Ascendant for much of modern history, this class is in decline while those below them, the new Serfs, grow in numbers―a vast, expanding property-less population. The trends are mounting, but we can still reverse them―if people understand what is actually occurring and have the capability to oppose them.},

The magnitude of such adverse fiscal externalities depends in part on the nature of state and local funding policies. In this paper, we examine the fiscal effects of charter schools on both urban and nonurban school districts in North Carolina. We base our analysis on detailed balance sheet information for a sample of school districts that experienced substantial charter growth since the statewide cap on charters was raised in 2011. We find a large and negative fiscal impact in excess of \$500 per traditional public school pupil in our one urban school district, which translates into an average fiscal cost of about \$3,600 for each student enrolled in charter schools. We estimate comparable to somewhat larger fiscal externalities per charter school pupil for two nonurban districts.},

The magnitude of such adverse fiscal externalities depends in part on the nature of state and local funding policies. In this paper, we examine the fiscal effects of charter schools on both urban and nonurban school districts in North Carolina. We base our analysis on detailed balance sheet information for a sample of school districts that experienced substantial charter growth since the statewide cap on charters was raised in 2011. We find a large and negative fiscal impact in excess of \$500 per traditional public school pupil in our one urban school district, which translates into an average fiscal cost of about \$3,600 for each student enrolled in charter schools. We estimate comparable to somewhat larger fiscal externalities per charter school pupil for two nonurban districts.},

  abstract = {Current U.S. policy initiatives to improve the U.S. education system , including No Child Left Behind, test-based evaluation of teachers, and the promotion of competition are misguided because they either deny or set to the side a basic body of evidence documenting that students from disadvantaged households on average perform less well in school than those from more advantaged families. Because these policy initiatives do not directly address the educational challenges experienced by disadvantaged students, they have contributed little - and are not likely to contribute much in the future - to raising overall student achievement or to reducing achievement and educational attainment gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students. Moreover, such policies have the potential to do serious harm. Addressing the educational challenges faced by children from disadvantaged families will require a broader and bolder approach to education policy than the recent efforts to reform schools. © 2012 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.},

One of the sources fueling this growth is an extensive1 Overbuilding: How many schools are too many? • 19 network of government programs that provide public funding or tax subsidies for charter school buildings. Over the past 15 years, California charter schools have received over \$2.5 billion in tax dollars or taxpayer subsidized funds to lease, build, or buy school buildings. This report finds that this funding is almost completely disconnected from educational policy objectives, and the results are, in turn, scattershot and haphazard. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent each year without any meaningful strategy. Far too much of this public funding is spent on schools built in neighborhoods that have no need for additional classroom space, and which offer no improvement over the quality of education already available in nearby public schools. In the worst cases, public facilities funding has gone to schools that were found to have discriminatory enrollment policies and others that have engaged in unethical or corrupt practices.},

  abstract = {In the aftermath of the 2010 Citizens United decision, it's become commonplace to note the growing political dominance of a small segment of the economic elite. But what exactly are those members of the elite doing with their newfound influence? The One Percent Solution provides an answer to this question for the first time. Gordon Lafer's book is a comprehensive account of legislation promoted by the nation's biggest corporate lobbies across all fifty state legislatures and encompassing a wide range of labor and economic policies. In an era of growing economic insecurity, it turns out that one of the main reasons life is becoming harder for American workers is a relentless--and concerted--offensive by the country's best-funded and most powerful political forces: corporate lobbies empowered by the Supreme Court to influence legislative outcomes with an endless supply of cash. These actors have successfully championed hundreds of new laws that lower wages, eliminate paid sick leave, undo the right to sue over job discrimination, and cut essential public services. Lafer shows how corporate strategies have been shaped by twenty-first-century conditions--including globalization, economic decline, and the populism reflected in both the Trump and Sanders campaigns of 2016. Perhaps most important, Lafer shows that the corporate legislative agenda has come to endanger the scope of democracy itself. For anyone who wants to know what to expect from corporate-backed Republican leadership in Washington, D.C., there is no better guide than this record of what the same set of actors has been doing in the state legislatures under its control.},

  abstract = {From 2008 to 2015, charter school enrollment in Pennsylvania more than doubled, growing from under 64,000 students to nearly 135,000 students.i In Pennsylvania, as in many states, a student’s transition from a traditional public or private school to a charter school creates addi- tional costs to the district of residence, mostly in the form of new charter tuition payments and increased administrative and oversight costs. There are also savings a district can realize for each student that it no longer educates in its own schools. The difference between the increased costs of charter expansion (charter tuition payments) and the savings a district can realize as students depart (variable costs) is considered the fiscal impact of charter expansion. While several studies have estimated the impact of charter school expansion, estimates vary widely, and the methods for calculating them have often not been transparent. Moreover, these studies did not take important district variations or the rate of charter expansion into account. To address these shortcomings, RFA designed a transparent accounting-based projection model to estimate the fiscal impact of charter school expansion. The instrument used for these calculations—the Charter Impact Calculation Tool—is also available for public use.},

Achievement is estimated from 225,000 observations weighted to be district representative. Estimates are made with OLS, geographic discontinuity models exploiting differences at state borders, and 2SLS models that use changes in housing prices as an instrument. For every 10 percent increase in local revenue share, achievement increases by a sizeable 0.02 to 0.06 standard deviations. Gains for students from low socio-economic backgrounds are about half those from higher ones. Both voice and exit channels moderate the efficiency-equity trade-off. Implications for federalism and state policy are discussed.},

Strictness makes organizations stronger and more attractive because it reduces free riding. It screens out members who lack commitment and stimulates participation among those who remain. Rational choice theory thus explains the success of sects, cults, and conservative denominations without recourse to assumptions of irrationality, abnormality, or misinformation. The theory also predicts differences between strict and lenient groups, distinguishes between effective and counterproductive demands, and demonstrates the need to adapt strict demands in response to social change.},

While the adoption of a metaphor of healthy campus climate is not novel per se, it remains under-theorized. As such, this paper aims to contribute to the conversation around diversity and campus climate by suggesting that a health metaphor applied to the study of campus climate is apropos and helps humanize the experiences of historically minoritized bodies in higher education.},

  abstract = {Major policy debates have arisen around the subject of educational vouchers as an alternative for financing and organizing elementary and secondary education. To a large degree, comparisons between vouchers and the traditional system of educational finance and school operations have been limited to one or two dimensions of education such as the relative impact of a particular system on achievement test scores. This article describes a comprehensive, evaluative framework that draws upon a larger range of goals that have been posed for education in a democratic and free society. These criteria include: (a) freedom of choice, (b) productive efficiency, (c) equity, and (d) social cohesion. The framework demonstrates the importance of and tradeoffs among these four criteria in evaluating specific educational voucher plans and enables comparisons with other alternatives such as charter schools as well as the more traditional public school arrangements.},

TIMSS uses four international benchmarks for describing student achievement: Low, Intermediate, High, and Advanced. In this study, we linked the eighth-grade Math TIMSS and NAEP scales using equipercentile equating to (a) help better interpret U.S. eighth-grade students’ performance on TIMSS, and (b) investigate the progress of eighth-grade U.S. students over time relative to the progress of students in other countries. Results indicated that relative to other countries, U.S. eighth-grade students increased with respect to the “At or Above Basic” NAEP Achievement level, but that other countries saw larger improvements in the higher achievement level categories, relative to the US. This finding may reflect the emphasis of No Child Left Behind on raising lower achievement to “proficient.” However, with respect to “Advanced” mathematics achievement, eighth-grade U.S. students showed less improvement than students in other countries.},

Results reinforce early studies revealing the intense and fragmented nature of principals’ work, but results question whether ISLLC provides sufficient guidance for principals’ instructional leadership performance as compared to Kentucky’s SISI. ISLLC seems to offer better descriptions of legal and ethical standards as well as guidance on building community internally and externally to the school; however, ISLLC is silent about principals’ interactions with students.},

Study topics included the quality of NAEP data, the number and character of NAEP scales, the robustness of NAEP trend lines, the trustworthiness of and interpretation of group comparisons, the validity of interpretations of NAEP anchor points and achievement levels, the linking of other test results to NAEP, the effects of student motivation on performance, the adequacy of NAEP data on student background and instructional experiences, and what is understood from NAEP reports by educators and policy makers. This report describes the questions addredsed by each study and summarizes the most important findings. In addition, general conclusions based on this body of research are presented and related to the major purposes of NAEP. A general conclusion is that the evolving and growing range of uses to which NAEP is put will create the need for ongoing validation work of the sort illustrated by the Panel's studies.},

Argument: In this article, we posit that a fundamentally different conversation surrounding the legacy of Brown is needed if we are to critically understand the past, present, and future of race relations as a backdrop to issues of segregated schooling in this country. Implications: The troublesome legacy of Brown provides a unique opportunity to interrogate why we, as a country, continue to have faith in this particular court decision as a remedy for racial inequality. We invite readers to symbolically “let go” of Brown in order to imagine new possibilities for racial justice, educational opportunity, and social reform.},

  abstract = {Neoliberal reformers have emphasized the role that market mechanisms can play in reconfiguring the public sector. In education, reformers argue that consumer choice and school competition can lead to more effective and efficient public education systems. Debates over education policy have highlighted the question of whether or not parental choice of schools represents a form of privatization — a question reflecting the tension over the extent to which schools should be directly subject to market forces. This analysis demonstrates that these debates in education are argued largely around supply-side issues important in other sectors undergoing privatization. A comprehensive review of debates in areas such as telecommunications, security/defense, and health care in indicates that neoliberal reformers and their critics are focused particularly on the ownership of the means of production or provision. In that regard, reformers contend that private managers are better positioned to administer public assets in the interest of the public good, even if the means of production/provision such as schools are still technically owned by the "public." However, this thinking, drawing from other sectors, neglects the counter-dynamic in education: the way education is provided can determine its nature as a public or private good. The concluding discussion suggests that this dynamic is most apparent not in ownership, but in modes of control, where educational decision-making is privatized, and the purposes of education are individualized. This analysis demonstrates that debates over the issue obscure the unique patterns that characterize the growing influence of private interests in education.},

I argue that the architects of this network’s project of radical transformation of our institutions and legal system have adopted this tactic in the knowledge that the hard-core libertarian agenda is extremely unpopular and therefore requires stealth to succeed. The chapter tells the story of how Charles Koch and his inner circle, having determined in the 1970s that changes significant enough to constitute a “constitutional revolution” (in the words of the political economist James McGill Buchanan) would be needed to protect capitalism from democracy, then went about experimenting to make this desideratum a reality. In the 1980s, they first incubated ideas for misleading the public to move their agenda, as shown by the strategy for Social Security privatization that Buchanan recommended to Koch’s Cato Institute, and by the operations of Citizens for a Sound Economy, the network’s first and very clumsy astroturf organizing effort. In the light of these foundational efforts, subsequent practices of active disinformation by this network become more comprehensible as driven by a mix of messianic dogma and self-interest for a project that cannot succeed by persuasion and organizing alone in the usual manner. Later cases include tobacco “scholarship” for hire by Buchanan’s colleagues at George Mason University to deter the public health campaign against smoking, climate science denial to stop action on global warming, promotion of the myth of mass voter fraud to leverage racism to restrict the electorate, assurances that an Article V Constitutional Convention is a good idea and can be restricted to a few pre-announced changes, and the use of concocted memes of violent mobs that must be restrained to win passage of new legislation to criminalize protest, particularly against the fossil fuel industry (including SLAPP lawsuits and laws to penalize alleged infringements on “academic freedom”).},

  abstract = {Metrics are useful for measuring systems and motivating behaviors. Unfortunately, naive application of metrics to a system can distort the system in ways that undermine the original goal. The problem was noted independently by first Campbell, then Goodhart, and in some forms it is not only common, but unavoidable due to the nature of metrics. (Campbell, 1979; Goodhart, 1975; Rodamar, 2017; Manheim \& Garrabrant, 2018) There are two distinct but interrelated problems that must be overcome in building better metrics; first, specifying metrics more closely related to the true goals, and second, preventing the recipients from gaming the difference between the reward system and the true goal. This paper describes several approaches to designing metrics, beginning with design considerations and processes, then discussing specific strategies including secrecy, randomization, diversification, and post-hoc specification. The discussion will then address important desiderata and the trade-offs involved in each approach, and examples of how they differ, and how the issues can be addressed. Finally, the paper outlines a process for metric design for practicioners who need to design metrics, and as a basis for further elaboration in specific domains.},

  abstract = {Many states have implemented or expanded state‐funded prekindergarten programs in the last decade, encouraged by claims about the benefits that can be expected and the importance of early experiences for children’s development, especially for economically disadvantaged children. However, there is remarkably little methodologically adequate evidence about the effects of such programs. Using a subsample of children with parental consent from a larger sample of children randomly assigned to attend the Tennessee pre‐k program or not, this study examined effects on cognitive and noncognitive outcomes through third grade. At the end of the pre‐k year, program participants showed better outcomes than comparable nonparticipants on achievement measures and ratings of school readiness by kindergarten teachers. But those effects were not sustained in subsequent years and, indeed, by the end of third grade the pre‐k participants scored lower on the achievement measures than nonparticipants. These results raise questions about the way state pre‐k programs have been designed and implemented.},

The report relies on a proprietary dataset to make its claims; however, the data conflict with publicly reported figures, and the methods used to create the dataset are not documented. The report’s analysis ignores several basics of school finance: Differences in student characteristics and school programming are not accounted for, categorical spending is conflated with potential profit taking from charter management organizations, and philanthropic giving is inadequately evaluated. The sparse documenta- tion of the report’s methods, combined with basic flaws in its analysis frameworks, render it useless in guiding charter school funding policy.},

NMTCs are allocated by the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI), a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, under a competitive application process. Investors who make qualified equity investments reduce their federal income tax liability by claiming the credit. The NMTC program, enacted in 2000, is currently authorized to allocate \$61 billion through the end of 2019. As of May 23, 2019, the CDFI has made 1,178 awards totaling \$57.5 billion in NMTC allocation authority. Demand for NMTC allocations has exceeded total allocations each award round—with the 2018 allocation round awarding \$3.5 billion in allocation authority from applications requesting approximately \$14.8 billion in NMTCs. The most recent program extension was made in the 114th Congress. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act (Division Q of P.L. 114-113) extended the NMTC authorization through 2019 at \$3.5 billion per year.},

  abstract = {An examination of how today’s leading philanthropists are revolutionizing the field, using new methods to have a vastly greater impact on the world. For philanthropists of the past, charity was often a matter of simply giving money away. For the philanthrocapitalists – the new generation of billionaires who are reshaping the way they give – it’s like business. Largely trained in the corporate world, these “social investors” are using big-business-style strategies and expecting results and accountability to match. Bill Gates, the world's richest man, is leading the way: he has promised his entire fortune to finding a cure for the diseases that kill millions of children in the poorest countries in the world.  In Philanthrocapitalism, Matthew Bishop and Michael Green examine this new movement and its implications. Proceeding from interviews with some of the most powerful people on the planet—including Gates, Bill Clinton, George Soros, Angelina Jolie, and Bono, among others—they show how a web of wealthy, motivated donors has set out to change the world. Their results will have huge implications: In a climate resistant to government spending on social causes, their focused donations may be the greatest force for societal change in our world, and a source of political controversy. Combining on-the-ground anecdotes, expert analysis, and up-close profiles of the wealthy and powerful, this is a fascinating look at a small group of people who will change an enormous number of lives.}

  abstract = {Following up on a previous study, researchers sought to investigate whether the effect on reading and math scores of being in a charter school was different in urban areas compared with other areas and to explore what might contribute to such differences. Overall, the study finds a small positive effect of being in a charter school on both math and reading scores and finds that this effect is slightly stronger in urban environments. There are significant reasons to exercise caution, however. The study’s “virtual twin” technique is insufficiently documented, and it remains unclear and puzzling why the researchers use this approach rather than the more accepted approach of propensity score matching. Consequently, the study may not adequately control for the possibility that families selecting a charter school may be very different from those who do not. Other choices in the analysis and reporting, such as the apparent systematic exclusion of many lower-scoring students from the analyses, the estimation of growth, and the use of “days of learning” as a metric, are also insufficiently justified. Even setting aside such concerns over analytic methods, the actual effect sizes reported are very small, explaining well under a tenth of one percent of the variance in test scores. To call such an effect “substantial” strains credulity.},

  abstract = {The vast majority of literature on school choice, and charter schools in particular, focus on attending an elementary or middle school grades and often focus on test scores or other proximal outcomes. Much less is known about the long-term effects of attending a charter school in 9th grade. It is important to fill this information void for a few reasons. First, schools in general affect more than just students’ test scores. Second, secondary schools (including grades 9–12) make up a larger share of the charter sector. Third, school choice depends on freely available information for parents and students to make informed decisions about where to attend, including potential long-term benefits. We add to the empirical research on charter school effects by using a doubly-robust inverse probability weighted approach to evaluate the impacts of secondary charter school attendance on 9th grade behavioral outcomes and individuals propensity to commit crime and participate in elections as young adults in North Carolina, a state with a large and growing charter school sector.},

This study uses uncommon data sources and plagiarism software to detect a rarely observed relationship between interest group lobbyists and sitting Members of Congress. Comparison of letters to a Senate committee written by lobby groups to legislative amendments introduced by committee members reveals similar and even identical language, providing compelling evidence that groups persuaded legislators to introduce amendments valued by the group. Moreover, the analysis suggests that these language matches are more likely when the requesting lobby group hosts a fundraising event for the senator. The results hold while controlling for ideological agreement between the senator and the group, the group’s campaign contributions to the senator, and the group’s lobbying expenditures, annual revenue, and home-state connections.},

This book presents eight specific case studies of education reform implementation which capture how the design and implementation choices of policymakers are shaped by national and historical contexts. They offer real examples of the choices and constraints faced by policymakers and practitioners. The cases are a mix of nationally and locally mandated reforms with five examples from nations where the state initiated and guided reforms. The concluding synthesis chapter highlights commonalities and differences across the cases and disparate responses to shared concerns. Providing a breadth of real-world research, it will assist policymakers, practitioners and other stakeholders interested in system change.},

Established in 2008 as a pilot program in New Orleans, the LSP was expanded statewide in 2012. In this study, we estimate the achievement impacts of ever using an LSP voucher to enroll in one’s first-choice private school over the four year period spanning from 2012-13 (Year 1) through 2015-16 (Year 4). In contrast to our previous research, which indicated large initial negative achievement effects of the program that improved after two and three years of participation, the results presented here indicate large negative effects of LSP voucher usage after four years, especially in math. Similar to previous studies, we observe little evidence of differentiation in general effects by gender. However, in contrast to findings presented in our previous studies, African American students are reported to have significantly less negative impacts of voucher usage relative to other students.},

In particular, school performance measures for both vir- tual and blended schools indicate that they are not as successful as traditional public schools. Nevertheless, enrollment growth has continued. Compared to prior years, there has been a shift in source of growth, with more school dis- tricts opening their own virtual schools. However, these district-run schools have typically been small, with limited enrollment. Thus, while large virtual schools operated by for-profit education management organizations (EMOs) have lost considerable market share, they still dominate this sector. This report provides a census of full-time virtual and blended schools. It also includes stu- dent demographics, state-specific school performance ratings, and—where possible—an analysis of school performance measures.},

  abstract = {K12 Inc. enrolls more public school students than any other private education management organization in the U.S. Much has been written about K12 Inc. (referred to in this report simply as “K12”) by financial analysts and investigative journalists because it is a large, publicly traded company and is the dominant player in the operation and expansion of full-time virtual schools. This report provides a new perspective on the nation’s largest virtual school provider through a systematic review and analysis of student characteristics, school finance, and school performance of K12-operated schools. Using federal and state data, this report provides a description of the students served by K12 and the public revenues received and spent by the company at the school level. Further, the report presents evidence from a range of school performance measures and strives to understand and explain the overall weak performance of these virtual schools. While the authors share the excitement of new technologies and the potential these have to improve communication, teacher effectiveness, and learning, they recommend that policymakers move forward cautiously and only after piloting and thoroughly vetting new ideas. The authors express hope that their findings will help inform policymakers and motivate researchers to carefully study various aspects of full-time virtual schools. They conclude that a better understanding of virtual schools can serve to improve this new model and help ensure that full-time virtual schools can better serve students and the public as a whole.},

  abstract = {Evidence-centered assessment design (ECD) is an approach to constructing educational assessments in terms of evidentiary arguments. This paper provides an introduction to the basic ideas of ECD, as well as some of the terminology and models that have been developed to implement the approach. In particular, it presents the high-level models of the Conceptual Assessment Framework (CAF) and the Four-process Delivery Architecture for assessment delivery systems. Special attention is given to the role of probability-based reasoning in accumulating evidence across task performances, in terms of belief about unobservable variables that characterize the knowledge, skills, and/or abilities of students. This is the role traditionally associated with psychometric models, such as those of item response theory (IRT) and latent class models. To unify the ideas and to provide a foundation for extending probability-based reasoning in assessment applications more broadly, however, a more general expression in terms of graphical models is indicated. This brief overview of evidence-centered design provides the reader with a feel for where and how graphical models fit into the larger enterprise of educational and psychological assessment. A simple example based on familiar large-scale standardized tests such as the Graduate Record Examinations® (GRE®) is used to fix ideas.},

  abstract = {In 2018 virtual schools continued to be a focal point for policymakers. As proponents continued to make the case that virtual education can expand student choices and improve the efficiency of public education, full-time virtual schools (also sometimes referred to as virtual charter schools, virtual academies, online schools or cyber schools) have attracted a great deal of attention. Many argue that online curriculum can be tailored to individual students more effectively than curriculum in traditional classrooms, giving it the potential to promote greater student achievement than can be realized in traditional brick-and-mortar schools. These claims are not supported by the research evidence; nonetheless, the promise of lower costs—primarily for instructional personnel and facilities—continues to make virtual schools financially appealing to both policymakers and for-profit providers. This report provides disinterested scholarly analyses of the characteristics and performance of full-time, publicly funded K-12 virtual schools; reviews the relevant available research related to virtual school practices; provides an overview of recent state legislative efforts to craft virtual schools policy; and offers policy recommendations based on the available evidence.},

  abstract = {The Coleman Report argued that family background is a fundamental cause of educational outcomes, while demonstrating the weak predictive power of variation in expenditures and facilities. This paper investigates the effects of family background, expenditures, and the conditions of school facilities for the public high school class of 2004, first sampled in 2002 for the Education Longitudinal Study and then followed up in 2004, 2006, and 2012. The results demonstrate that expenditures and related school inputs have very weak associations not only with test scores in the sophomore and senior years of high school but also with high school graduation and subsequent college entry. Only for postsecondary educational attainment do we find any meaningful predictive power for expenditures, and here half of the association can be adjusted away by school-­level differences in average family background. Altogether, expenditures and facilities have much smaller associations with secondary and postsecondary outcomes than many scholars and policy advocates assume. The overall conclusion of the Coleman Report—that family background is far and away the most important determinant of educational achievement and attainment—is as convincing today as it was fifty years ago.},

  abstract = {We live on a wonderful planet that not only teems with life, but shows a marvellous exuberance of form and variety. From condors crossing tropical storms at altitudes as high as 6000 metres, to microscopic bacteria living many kilometres below the Earth's crust, life is pervasive.No one yet knows the precise total of species that presently inhabit the Earth, nor how many once existed but are now extinct, but the total must run into many billions. With such a vast array of life, it is perhaps surprising that only one species, our own, is able to understand and investigate its origins.Because we are different in so many ways from any other life form that has evolved on Earth, how do we know that our origins and history can be traced here, rather than as extra-terrestrial immigrants? The reason is simple: our evolutionary pedigree is stamped on every feature of our faces and bodies, and by looking at the fossil record, we can trace our progress back to and beyond those primitive fish whose basic brain structure is our inheritance today and whose fins and then limbs first propelled us through and then out of the water.In this book, renowned palaeontologist Simon Conway Morris explores how a single unit of rock, located in the west of Canada, and known as the Burgess Shale, has placed the history of life in a new set of contexts and so by implication has shed new light on our place in the scheme of evolution. He takes us through the fantastic discoveries of hitherto unknown species which were discovered in this isolated outcrop, where the processes of decay have been held in abeyance so that a window into the Cambrian period is opened to reveal the true richness of ancient life.We meet animals such as trilobites and molluscs, with tough, durable skeletons, but also, uniquely, soft-bodied animals from more than half-a-billion years ago.The Burgess Shale, with its remarkable richness of fossil remains has become an icon for anyone studying the history of life - a reference point of equal significance to Darwin's finches, which exemplifies the central role of adaptation.Professor Conway Morris guides us through the Burgess Shale and its significance, through the personalities involved, the mistakes they made, and most important of all considers whether the discoveries made there necessitate a radical reconsideration of the whole concept of evolution in the Darwinian framework.},

  abstract = {To inform evidence-based practice in health care, guidelines and policies require accurate identification, collation, and integration of all available evidence in a comprehensive, meaningful, and time-efficient manner. Approaches to evidence synthesis such as carefully conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential tools to summarize specific topics. Unfortunately, not all systematic reviews are truly systematic, and their quality can vary substantially. Since well-conducted evidence synthesis typically involves a complex set of steps, we believe formulating a cohesive, step-by-step guide on how to conduct a systemic review and meta-analysis is essential. While most of the guidelines on systematic reviews focus on how to report or appraise systematic reviews, they lack guidance on how to synthesize evidence efficiently. To facilitate the design and development of evidence syntheses, we provide a clear and concise, 24-step guide on how to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and clinical trials. We describe each step, illustrate it with concrete examples, and provide relevant references for further guidance. The 24-step guide (1) simplifies the methodology of conducting a systematic review, (2) provides healthcare professionals and researchers with methodologically sound tools for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and (3) it can enhance the quality of existing evidence synthesis efforts. This guide will help its readers to better understand the complexity of the process, appraise the quality of published systematic reviews, and better comprehend (and use) evidence from medical literature.},

  abstract = {There have been considerable methodological developments of Bayes factors for hypothesis testing in the social and behavioral sciences, and related fields. This development is due to the flexibility of the Bayes factor for testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, the ability to test complex hypotheses involving equality as well as order constraints on the parameters of interest, and the interpretability of the outcome as the weight of evidence provided by the data in support of competing scientific theories. The available software tools for Bayesian hypothesis testing are still limited however. In this paper we present a new R package called BFpack that contains functions for Bayes factor hypothesis testing for the many common testing problems. The software includes novel tools for (i) Bayesian exploratory testing (e.g., zero vs positive vs negative effects), (ii) Bayesian confirmatory testing (competing hypotheses with equality and/or order constraints), (iii) common statistical analyses, such as linear regression, generalized linear models, (multivariate) analysis of (co)variance, correlation analysis, and random intercept models, (iv) using default priors, and (v) while allowing data to contain missing observations that are missing at random.},

From 1969 through 2018, there also have been different approaches to dissemination efforts, access to the data for further research, and the degree of support given to potential users.

Using National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading and math test results for seven different cohorts of fourth and eighth graders, the study compares student performance trends in the charter and district sectors between 2005 and 2017. Based on the comparisons of overall performance changes as well as subgroup analysis by student ethnicity, socioeconomic status, region, and locale, the study concludes that charter schools had enhanced performance relative to that of district schools. However, because NAEP does not track the performance of individual students over time, the analysis of performance trends of different cohorts does not allow causal conclusions about the relative effectiveness of the charter and district sectors in raising student achievement. In addition, the study suffers from several methodological weaknesses around sampling, control of extraneous variables, and determination of statistical significance. Due to these limitations, the study fails to advance our knowledge of charter school effectiveness and offers no solid base for policy recommendations regarding whether charters merit more or less investment, nor any insight into what practices and changes might benefit the charter sector.},

  abstract = {Drawing on their extensive research, Nichols and Berliner document and categorize the ways that high-stakes testing threatens the purposes and ideals of the American education system. For more than a decade, the debate over high-stakes testing has dominated the field of education. This passionate and provocative book provides a fresh perspective on the issue and powerful ammunition for opponents of high-stakes tests. Their analysis is grounded in the application of Campbell’s Law, which posits that the greater the social consequences associated with a quantitative indicator (such as test scores), the more likely it is that the indicator itself will become corrupted—and the more likely it is that the use of the indicator will corrupt the social processes it was intended to monitor. Nichols and Berliner illustrate both aspects of this “corruption,” showing how the pressures of high-stakes testing erode the validity of test scores and distort the integrity of the education system. Their analysis provides a coherent and comprehensive intellectual framework for the wide-ranging arguments against high-stakes testing, while putting a compelling human face on the data marshalled in support of those arguments.},

  abstract = {Recent reforms in education emphasize the use of charter schools as a viable strategy to improve student achievement. It is, therefore, important to understand which types of charter schools are effective. I study this question utilizing longitudinal data covering all public school students in the large urban school district of Milwaukee which has a long history of charter schools. Using student fixed effects to deal with self-selection, I find that charter schools, on average, have no significant effect on student achievement. However, I show that this average effect masks important heterogeneity in the effectiveness of charter schools across types of charter schools. Charter schools with higher autonomy from the district in terms of financial budget, academic program, and hiring decisions, are effective. I show that students in these charter schools would read at a grade level higher than similar students who attend traditional public schools in three years.},

  abstract = {Triangulation is a method used to increase the credibility and validity of research findings.1 Credibility refers to trustworthiness and how believable a study is; validity is concerned with the extent to which a study accurately reflects or evaluates the concept or ideas being investigated.2 Triangulation, by combining theories, methods or observers in a research study, can help ensure that fundamental biases arising from the use of a single method or a single observer are overcome. Triangulation is also an effort to help explore and explain complex human behaviour using a variety of methods to offer a more balanced explanation to readers.2 It is a procedure that enables validation of data and can be used in both quantitative and qualitative studies. Triangulation can enrich research as it offers a variety of datasets to explain differing aspects of a phenomenon of interest. It also helps refute where one dataset invalidates a supposition generated by another. It can assist the confirming of a hypothesis where one set of findings confirms another set. Finally, triangulation can help explain the results of a study.3 Central to triangulation is the notion that methods leading to the same results give more confidence in the research findings.4  Four types of triangulation are proposed by Denzin (p.301):5 (1)~data triangulation, which~includes matters …},

  abstract = {The lack of quality education many charter schools offer disproportionately and adversely impacts communities of color. This article considered two models of charter school governance in use by California and Ohio. The first model posits that a fundamental tenet of charter schools is freedom from the burdensome bureaucracy traditional public schools bear. Based on the argument that deregulation enables charter schools to employ more innovative instructional and management practices, it assumes higher achievement scores would follow. The second model proposes to address educational inequality by increasing accountability on charter school authorizers by increasing regulatory practices. These models example the variety of governance models extant. In addition, arguments supporting each model are presented. The authors conclude with a discussion that supports the position that while autonomy is essential to maintaining the original objectives of charter schools, states must hold authorizers accountable for student achievement.},

After an introduction to the problem of overcoming social dilemmas through collective action, the remainder of this article is divided into six sections. The first briefly reviews the theoretical predictions of currently accepted rational choice theory related to social dilemmas. The second section summarizes the challenges to the sole reliance on a complete model of rationality presented by extensive experimental research. In the third section, I discuss two major empirical findings that begin to show how individuals achieve results that are “better than rational” by building conditions where reciprocity, reputation, and trust can help to overcome the strong temptations of short-run self-interest. The fourth section raises the possibility of developing second-generation models of rationality, the fifth section develops an initial theoretical scenario, and the final section concludes by examining the implications of placing reciprocity, reputation, and trust at the core of an empirically tested, behavioral theory of collective action.},

Using a content analysis of 46,218 cable and broadcast television news transcripts from the 109th through 112th Congresses, we examined the frequency with which members of Congress appeared on cable and broadcast news. When we modelled on-air statements by members of Congress as a function of legislator and institutional characteristics, we revealed a gatekeeping function that vastly overrepresents extreme partisans on both sides of the aisle. The effect is largely consistent for network and cable outlets alike, suggesting that gatekeeping processes under both market and advocacy models bias content towards the extreme and conflictual. This finding is particularly important in light of recent evidence linking mediadriven misperceptions about polarization to partisan-ideological sorting and negative political affect in the electorate.},

  abstract = {In 2016, when millions of Americans voted for Donald Trump, many believed his claims that personal wealth would free him from wealthy donors and allow him to “drain the swamp.” But then Trump appointed several billionaires and multimillionaires to high-level positions and pursued billionaire-friendly policies, such as cutting corporate income taxes. Why the change from his fiery campaign rhetoric and promises to the working class? This should not be surprising, argue Benjamin I. Page, Jason Seawright, and Matthew J. Lacombe: As the gap between the wealthiest and the rest of us has widened, the few who hold one billion dollars or more in net worth have begun to play a more and more active part in politics—with serious consequences for democracy in the United States. Page, Seawright, and Lacombe argue that while political contributions offer a window onto billionaires’ influence, especially on economic policy, they do not present a full picture of policy preferences and political actions. That is because on some of the most important issues, including taxation, immigration, and Social Security, billionaires have chosen to engage in “stealth politics.” They try hard to influence public policy, making large contributions to political parties and policy-focused causes, leading policy-advocacy organizations, holding political fundraisers, and bundling others’ contributions—all while rarely talking about public policy to the media. This means that their influence is not only unequal but also largely unaccountable to and unchallengeable by the American people. Stealth politics makes it difficult for ordinary citizens to know what billionaires are doing or mobilize against it. The book closes with remedies citizens can pursue if they wish to make wealthy Americans more politically accountable, such as public financing of political campaigns and easier voting procedures, and notes the broader types of reforms, such as a more progressive income tax system, that would be needed to increase political equality and reinvigorate majoritarian democracy in the United States.}

  abstract = {The term “learning styles” refers to the concept that individuals differ in regard to what mode of instruction or study is most effective for them. Proponents of learning-style assessment contend that optimal instruction requires diagnosing individuals' learning style and tailoring instruction accordingly. Assessments of learning style typically ask people to evaluate what sort of information presentation they prefer (e.g., words versus pictures versus speech) and/or what kind of mental activity they find most engaging or congenial (e.g., analysis versus listening), although assessment instruments are extremely diverse. The most common—but not the only—hypothesis about the instructional relevance of learning styles is the meshing hypothesis, according to which instruction is best provided in a format that matches the preferences of the learner (e.g., for a “visual learner,” emphasizing visual presentation of information).             The learning-styles view has acquired great influence within the education field, and is frequently encountered at levels ranging from kindergarten to graduate school. There is a thriving industry devoted to publishing learning-styles tests and guidebooks for teachers, and many organizations offer professional development workshops for teachers and educators built around the concept of learning styles.             The authors of the present review were charged with determining whether these practices are supported by scientific evidence. We concluded that any credible validation of learning-styles-based instruction requires robust documentation of a very particular type of experimental finding with several necessary criteria. First, students must be divided into groups on the basis of their learning styles, and then students from each group must be randomly assigned to receive one of multiple instructional methods. Next, students must then sit for a final test that is the same for all students. Finally, in order to demonstrate that optimal learning requires that students receive instruction tailored to their putative learning style, the experiment must reveal a specific type of interaction between learning style and instructional method: Students with one learning style achieve the best educational outcome when given an instructional method that differs from the instructional method producing the best outcome for students with a different learning style. In other words, the instructional method that proves most effective for students with one learning style is not the most effective method for students with a different learning style.             Our review of the literature disclosed ample evidence that children and adults will, if asked, express preferences about how they prefer information to be presented to them. There is also plentiful evidence arguing that people differ in the degree to which they have some fairly specific aptitudes for different kinds of thinking and for processing different types of information. However, we found virtually no evidence for the interaction pattern mentioned above, which was judged to be a precondition for validating the educational applications of learning styles. Although the literature on learning styles is enormous, very few studies have even used an experimental methodology capable of testing the validity of learning styles applied to education. Moreover, of those that did use an appropriate method, several found results that flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis.             We conclude therefore, that at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning-styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number. However, given the lack of methodologically sound studies of learning styles, it would be an error to conclude that all possible versions of learning styles have been tested and found wanting; many have simply not been tested at all. Further research on the use of learning-styles assessment in instruction may in some cases be warranted, but such research needs to be performed appropriately.},

The data indicate parents consider several key factors when selecting schools for their children including academics, class size, and differentiated instruction and support for their children; the school and administration’s relationship to diversity and the community; and the overall enrollment process. The parents’ narratives also revealed educational leaders must create a culturally relevant learning community in order to ensure parents, students, and community stakeholders will garner the support, resources, curricula, and learning activities to stop the exodus of children from schools within the school district.},

  abstract = {Prior research on trends in educational inequality has focused chiefly on changing gaps in educational attainment by family income or parental occupation. In contrast, this contribution provides the first assessment of trends in educational attainment by family wealth and suggests that we should be at least as concerned about growing wealth gaps in education. Despite overall growth in educational attainment and some signs of decreasing wealth gaps in high school attainment and college access, I find a large and rapidly increasing wealth gap in college attainment between cohorts born in the 1970s and 1980s, respectively. This growing wealth gap in higher educational attainment co-occurred with a rise in inequality in children's wealth backgrounds, although the analyses also suggest that the latter does not fully account for the former. Nevertheless, the results reported here raise concerns about the distribution of educational opportunity among today's children who grow up in a context of particularly extreme wealth inequality.},

  title = {National {{Benchmarks}} for {{State Achievement Standards}}},
  author = {Phillips, Gary},
  date = {2016-02},
  pages = {28},
  institution = {{American Institutes for Research}},
  abstract = {State achievement standards represent how much the state expects their students to learn in order to reach various levels of academic proficiency. In this study, the academic subjects are English language arts (ELA) and mathematics. In the past, these achievement standards were used by each state to report adequate yearly progress (AYP) under No Child Left Behind (NCLB) federal legislation, and they are currently being used for federal reporting under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) of 2015. These standards are also used by the state to monitor progress from year to year and to report on the success of each classroom, school, and district to parents and the public. This report uses national benchmarking as a common metric to examine state achievement standards and compare how high these standards are compared to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) achievement levels. It also compares how much students are expected to learn in some states with how much they are expected to learn in other states. The study uses NAEP grades 4 and 8 reading and mathematics as benchmarks for individual state achievement standards. The study also benchmarks the achievement standards of Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (referred to in this study as Smarter Balanced), Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), and ACT Aspire. Benchmarking Smarter Balanced, PARCC, and ACT Aspire provides a common metric (i.e., the NAEP scale) that can be used to compare the stringency of their achievement standards. The most important findings in the study relate to achievement standards that represent college readiness. Each of these consortium tests in grades 4 and 8 has achievement standards that indicate the student is on track to be college ready. The college-ready standards are Level 3 (Met) for Smarter Balanced, Level 4 (Met) for PARCC, and Level 3 (Ready) for ACT Aspire. The overall findings in the study are: 1. Smarter Balanced college-ready standards (Level 3) are comparable in difficulty to the NAEP Basic levels. 2. Smarter Balanced college-ready standards (Level 3) are significantly below PARCC college-ready standards (Level 4) by about one-quarter of a standard deviation. In the statistical literature, a standard deviation unit is referred to as an effect size. The effect sizes are for ELA grades 4 and 8, and mathematics grades 4 and 8 are −.26, −.28, −.26 and −.36, respectively. 3. Smarter Balanced college-ready grade 8 standards are comparable to ACT Aspire college-ready grade 8 standards. However, for grade 4, the Smarter Balanced college- ready standard is significantly below the ACT Aspire college-ready standard for Reading (effect size = −.26) but significantly above the ACT Aspire college-ready standard for mathematics (effect size = +.29). 4. PARCC college-ready standards (Level 4) are comparable in difficulty to the NAEP Basic level for ELA and comparable to the NAEP Proficient level for mathematics. 5. PARCC college-ready standards (Level 4) are comparable in difficulty to the ACT Aspire college-ready standard for Reading grade 4. However, PARCC standards are significantly above ACT Aspire college-ready standards for ELA grade 8 (effect size = +.28), mathematics grade 4 (effect size = +.55), and mathematics grade 8 (effect size = +.48). 6. ACT Aspire college-ready standards (Ready) are comparable in difficulty to the NAEP Basic levels. 7. Individual states that have college-readiness standards that map to the NAEP Proficient level are: a. ELA grade 4—Florida and New York; b. ELA grade 8—Florida, Kansas, and New York; c. Mathematics grade 4—Florida and Kansas; and d. Mathematics grade 8—Alaska, Florida, Kansas, New York, and Pennsylvania. Note that Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas have three achievement levels, instead of the usual four levels or five levels in other states. At the time of this report, the author was unable to determine which levels in these states represented college readiness},

Results from this investigation revealed that in unadjusted models, children with a history of enrollment in private schools performed better on nearly all outcomes assessed in adolescence. However, by simply controlling for the sociodemographic characteristics that selected children and families into these schools, all of the advantages of private school education were eliminated. There was also no evidence to suggest that low-income children or children enrolled in urban schools benefited more from private school enrollment.},

I conduct an integrative literature review that combines conceptual analyses with findings from empirical investigations into new policymaking tactics and their influence on policy development. Specifically, I explore (a) the discourses justifying policy priorities over time, and (b) the role of democratic engagement in dominant modes of policymaking. I demonstrate that various sources combine to tell a troubling story about the longstanding exclusion of the public from policymaking regarding its public schools. Further, I argue that, perhaps paradoxically, the increased use of the ballot initiative only exacerbates this trend. Ultimately, I use results from the reviewed research to ask if there is a better way to make policy, one that aspires to higher democratic ideals.},

  abstract = {School principals’ education and professional experience shape their approach to school leadership and how successful their students will be. However, it is not clear from existing research which aspects of principal education and professional experience are related to student outcomes and principal retention. This dissertation explores aspects of a potential principal’s education and professional experience that states and school districts should look for and cultivate in candidates for the position of school principal. The work was guided by two research questions: 1) how are principals’ education and professional experience related to student outcomes and principal retention? and 2) how can state certification and district hiring policies better incorporate information about a principal’s education and professional experience to improve principal effectiveness? Using information on principals trained by the New Leaders program and school-level data from four large urban districts, I analyzed the relationships between principal education and professional experience and student outcomes and principal retention. I examined state certification and district hiring policies for the four urban districts used in the analysis and conducted a survey of 33 districts regarding their hiring policies and practices. From this research, I provide recommendations designed to inform state certification policy, district hiring policy, and training program curricula.},

  abstract = {A sweeping examination of how American racism has broken the country's social compact, eroded America's common goods, and damaged the lives of every American--and a heartfelt look at how these deep wounds might begin to heal. Compared to other industrialized nations, the United States is losing ground across nearly every indicator of social health. Its race problem, argues Eduardo Porter, is largely to blame. In American Poison,  the New York Times veteran shows how racial animus has stunted the development of nearly every institution crucial for a healthy society, including organized labor, public education, and the social safety net. The consequences are profound and are only growing graver with time. Leading us through history and across America--from FDR's New Deal through Bill Clinton's welfare reform to Donald Trump's retrograde and divisive policies--Porter pieces together how racial hostility has blocked American social cohesion at every turn, producing a nation that fails not only its black and brown citizens but white Americans as well. American Poison is at once a broad, rigorous argument, and a profound cri de coeur. Even as it uncovers our most tenacious national pathology, it points the way toward hope, illuminating the ways in which, as the nation becomes increasingly diverse, it may well be possible to construct a new understanding of racial identity--and a more cohesive society on top of it.},

  abstract = {Understanding how money influences the legislative process is essential for assessing American democracy, but problems of endogeneity, legality, and observational equivalence make it difficult to isolate the effect of contributions on policy. We seek to answer longstanding questions about the influence of money in Congress by exploiting a congressional procedure (committee exile) that exogenously varies a member’s influence over the policy-making process. We leverage exile as an identification strategy to show that business interests seek short-term access to influential legislators. Industries overseen by the committee decrease contributions to exiled legislators, and instead direct their contributions to new committee members from the opposite party. Partisan interests, in contrast, attempt to influence electoral outcomes—boosting contributions to exiled members. Together, we provide evidence that corporations and business PACs use donations to acquire immediate access and favor—suggesting they at least anticipate that the donations will influence policy.},

  abstract = {Technology has the potential to increase access to education, enhance learning experiences, and reduce the cost of providing high-quality postsecondary education. However, despite the explosive growth of online education, which has been disproportionately large in the for-profit sector, our review of the evidence shows that this potential has not been realized. Instead, on average fully online coursework has contributed to increasing gaps in educational success across socioeconomic groups while failing to improve affordability. Even when overall outcomes are similar for classroom and online courses, students with weak academic preparation and those from low-income and under-represented backgrounds consistently underperform in fully-online environments. Success rates are lower and employers—in addition to students, faculty, academic leaders, and the public—attribute lower value to online than to classroom degrees. A strong body of evidence, as well as industry best practices, have consistently emphasized the critical role of frequent and meaningful interaction between students and instructors for increasing the quality of the online educational experience and improving student outcomes and satisfaction. Weakening federal requirements for regular and substantive interaction between students and faculty in online courses would likely decrease educational quality, further erode employer confidence in the value of online credentials, increase barriers to postsecondary success, and expand opportunities for some institutions to exploit vulnerable students and federal student aid programs.},

  abstract = {This article presents a synthesis of reports and research on K-12 blended teaching competencies compared with K-12 online teaching competencies. The skills needed to teach in online and blended environments are distinct from traditional teaching, but teacher education programs often do not equip preservice teachers for the new modes of instruction. Additionally, there is a dearth of research on blended teaching competencies. This review synthesizes 8 blended teaching documents and 10 online teaching documents. Seven global themes identified in both competency domains are (1) pedagogy, (2) management, (3) assessment, (4) technology, (5) instructional design, (6) dispositions, and (7) improvement. The top 20 blended teaching skills include flexibility and personalization, mastery-based learning, data usage and interpretation, learning management system usage, online discussion facilitation, and software management. The authors recommend that researchers collect more methodologically transparent data about blended teaching and that teacher education programs include the identified skills in curriculum.},

  abstract = {A vast research literature documents racial bias in teachers’ evaluations of students. Theory suggests bias may be larger on grading scales with vague or overly general criteria versus scales with clearly specified criteria, raising the possibility that well-designed grading policies may mitigate bias. This study offers relevant evidence through a randomized Web-based experiment with 1,549 teachers. On a vague grade-level evaluation scale, teachers rated a student writing sample lower when it was randomly signaled to have a Black author, versus a White author. However, there was no evidence of racial bias when teachers used a rubric with more clearly defined evaluation criteria. Contrary to expectation, I found no evidence that the magnitude of grading bias depends on teachers’ implicit or explicit racial attitudes.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is the result of a personal quest to figure out what would make real net positive change in schooling: What would it take to shift our schooling system so that it genuinely empowersindividuals as positive changemakers in their lives, and also fosters a thriving democracy? The overriding argument made is that if we wish to make this shift, we need systems change. Systems change requires we: 1) take a systems perspective; 2) discern the correct purposes forschooling; 3) define our shared aims or vision; and, 4) develop a deep understanding of human flourishing, societal thriving, and their relationship to schooling. This dissertation aligns with these steps and is organized as follows. 1. Introduction: Schooling as a System The introduction considers why schooling needs to be examined from a systems-perspective. Drawing on work in ecological and organizational systems, it outlines how a systems-perspective is differentthan most current perspectives on education, why this is important for thinking about schooling, and what theory suggests is needed to shift a system. 2. Clarifying the Purposes: A Meta-framework for the Purposes of Schooling The second chapter asks: 1) What are the different purposes of schooling and how are they related?; and, 2) Which purposes should be used to organize the actual practice – the organization, structure,and pedagogy, of schools? This chapter covers a new way of thinking about the role of schooling in society by presenting a comprehensive meta-framework for the purposes and aims of schooling. It argues there are four core purposes for schooling - Individual Possibility, Social Possibility, Social Efficiency, and Individual Efficiency, which can be mapped onto a 2x2 matrix, with axes: 1) Intrinsic—Instrumental; and 2)Individual–Collective. To thrive as a democracy the aims for organizing the practice of schooling should be rooted in the intrinsic purposes - Individual and Social Possibility. However, most research,reform, rhetoric, and policy in the U.S. frames the purpose as instrumental Individual Efficiency, which, if not addressed, will undermine society’s ability to evolve and thrive as a democracy. Intrinsic purposes are inherent to the actual practice and experience of schooling. When aims arising from the instrumental purposes are used to organize the structure, process, or practice of schooling, it thwarts the ability of a society to progress and thrive, in part because it limits the likelihood of anomalistic thinking and thereby decreases the overall ecological diversity of our society. Decreased diversity means limited protection to environmental changes or threats (I use these terms broadly to include cultural, social, technological, natural environment, or economic forces). The meta-framework for the purposes of schooling can be used to help discern the implicit assumptions in arguments and debates about potential school reforms, programs, policies, and re-search. The chapter concludes by applying the framework to two current movements in education: the standards movement and school choice movement. 3. Defining the Aims: Toward a Shared Vision Chapters 3 and 4 present the empirical research conducted on the aims for schooling: 57 in-depthinterviews with students, parents, and educators across two very different school communities: St.John’s College Preparatory (St. John’s), a private Catholic school serving a largely high-income community, and John Lewis Middle School (JLMS), an urban public school serving a majority middle to low-income community. The analytical questions make explicit each participant’s implicit “theory of change” for schooling. I started by asking about life aims – what makes a good life, now and in the future? – then asked about the role they would ideally like school to play in their lives, and finally whether they thought schools would do this. This research adds depth and nuance to previous research on ideas about the purposes of schooling. What participants talked about as the ideal role for their schools is considerably more nuanced than the typical “Prepare for a job,” “Prepare as a citizen,” “Prepare with academic skills” that previous survey research has asked about. My analysis suggests that what participants want for children’s lives, now and in the future, and from their schools, includes a breadth of areas not frequently discussed in current debates about schooling. Furthermore, participants’ answers similar to one another, and fit broadly with the Aristotelian ideas of flourishing or, eudaimonia – i.e. to live well, be well, and do well. However, while there was broad consensus about what it meant to live a good life and the role of school in creating it, a clear divide emerged between school contexts about opinions of whether each school would do this – St. John’s participants overwhelming said “yes,” while JLMS participants largely said, “no”. This finding contributes to the conversation about equity in schooling, and the chapter concludes with a discussion about implications for how we define equity (as empowering experience rather than attainment), and the role of schooling in creating a democratic society. 4. Schooling for Flourishing Individuals and a Thriving Democratic Society: A Model Chapter 5 presents a new model for thinking about the relationship between schooling and society and, in particular, how to think about schooling as a way to foster individual flourishing and a thriving democratic society. This model provides a necessary conceptual bridge between existing theories within philosophy, sociology, and social psychology. The main contribution is to bring these different perspectives together in one model, thereby putting them in conversation with one another and providing a more holistic theoretical view than currently exists in literature, research, or practice. The intention behind the model is to connect our aims (creating good lives) with our ideal role for schooling and a deeper understanding of what flourishing means. While the current narrative about school reform focuses on the extent to which schools develop specific competencies and skills (i.e. “learning”), I argue we must take a broader view. As a collective, we want to create a society in which everyone is able to flourish. Here, flourishing is defined as being able to make choices about their life paths that are aligned with their beliefs and values (their own unique constellation of preferences), and are able to work with others to change the options available to them if needed or desired. This requires a society in which all citizens: a) have fully developed the three components of agentic action (capacities, character, and beliefs); b) are accorded the freedoms necessary to make choices; and, c) have their basic core needs met (physiological and social psychological). Furthermore, if we are to create a thriving democratic society, we must consider how we will practice democracy in schools. Conclusion The dissertation concludes with a summary of the lessons from this work. I argue that one of the most fundamental shifts overall is that of “asking better questions” in education. We need more beautiful questions in research, reform, and policy – questions that shape new positive visions and expand our notion of what is possible.},

  abstract = {Qualitative case study methodology enables researchers to conduct an in-depth exploration of intricate phenomena within some specific context. By keeping in mind research students, this article presents a systematic step-by-step guide to conduct a case study in the business discipline. Research students belonging to said discipline face issues in terms of clarity, selection, and operationalization of qualitative case study while doing their final dissertation. These issues often lead to confusion, wastage of valuable time, and wrong decisions that affect the overall outcome of the research. This article presents a checklist comprised of four phases, that is, foundation phase, prefield phase, field phase, and reporting phase. The objective of this article is to provide novice researchers with practical application of this checklist by linking all its four phases with the authors’ experiences and learning from recently conducted in-depth multiple case studies in the organizations of New Zealand. Rather than discussing case study in general, a targeted step-by-step plan with real-time research examples to conduct a case study is given.},

In this paper, I examine sixteen distinct measures of segregation to determine which is most strongly associated with academic achievement gaps. I find clear evidence that one aspect of segregation in particular—the disparity in average school poverty rates between white and black students’ schools—is consistently the single most powerful correlate of achievement gaps, a pattern that holds in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. This implies that high-­poverty schools are, on average, much less effective than lower-­poverty schools and suggests that strategies that reduce the differential exposure of black, Hispanic, and white students to poor schoolmates may lead to meaningful reductions in academic achievement gaps.},

They have been produced by—and so may also be reduced by—a welter of social and economic policies, social norms and patterns of interaction, and the organization of American schooling. The Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA) is an initiative aimed at harnessing data to help us—scholars, policymakers, educators, parents—learn how to improve educational opportunity for all children. We are making the data files public so that anyone who is interested can obtain detailed information about American schools, communities, and student success. We hope that researchers will use these to generate evidence about what policies and contexts are most effective at increasing educational opportunity, and that such evidence will inform educational policy and practices. SEDA includes a range of detailed data on educational conditions, contexts, and outcomes in schools and school districts across the United States. It includes data at a range of institutional and geographic levels of aggregation, including schools, districts, counties, commuting zones, metropolitan areas, and states. It includes measures of academic achievement, achievement gaps, school and neighborhood racial and socioeconomic composition, school and neighborhood racial and socioeconomic segregation patterns, and other features of the schooling system. The data will be regularly updated as more data become available.},

Using an original data set of more than 16,000 contributions covering election cycles from 2008 to 2013 in four school districts (Los Angeles, CA; New Orleans, LA; Denver, CO; Bridgeport, CT), we show how large national donors play a significant role. Our study links two dynamic fields that are rarely studied together: (1) the behavior of wealthy donors in a changing national campaign finance system and (2) the evolving politics of urban education. By examining donor networks, we illuminate the mechanisms behind the nationalization of education politics and national donor involvement in local campaigns. We show that shared affiliations through education organizations are significantly associated with school board campaign contributions.},

Unfortunately, they also share a deep mutual suspicion. Recognizing that social ventures—just like traditional for-profit and nonprofit enterprises—need capital to flourish, this Article offers a financing tool to transform that skepticism into commitment. Unlike the array of new entities that have emerged in recent years—including L3Cs, benefit corporations, and flexible purpose corporations—the hybrid financial instrument this Article describes provides a robust and transparent solution to the puzzle that lies at the heart of every social enterprise: how to blend a profit motive with a social mission. Recognizing their shared dilemma as an example of what economists call a stag hunt, FLY Paper strikes that elusive balance by allowing investors and entrepreneurs to signal credibly a reciprocal commitment to the pursuit of a double bottom line.},

  abstract = {Charter schools have been categorized as "everyone's reform" (Bracey, 2004); they are a type of public school, first established in 1992, that normally has fewer restrictions than most public schools and that serves a student body that, in many circumstances, has consciously opted to attend the school. Charter schools have promised high student achievement and program options that would create healthy competition in the American educational market. Currently, in California alone, there are approximately 800 active charter schools that serve more than 340,000 pupils. As we close in on nearly twenty years of charter school reform, many charter schools could be considered successful. Every year, however, some have their charters either revoked or not renewed due to a variety of reasons including deficiencies in academic programming, poor student achievement, or improper fiscal mismanagement. According to the California Department of Education (2010), twenty-five percent of the 1,152 charter schools that have opened in California since 1992 have closed permanently, with more than forty closings due to charter revocation. To date, however, there has been very little research on charter school closures. This qualitative study attempted to (a) determine which types of California charter schools have closed, (b) discover the reasons the schools' former leaders give for the closures, as well as compare official reasons for closure with the schools' former leaders stated reasons for closure, and (c) solicit any advice the former leaders would offer others wanting to begin, or continue to successfully operate, a charter school. Reasons the former directors gave for their schools' closures included: (a) conflict with their sponsoring agent, (b) a negative relationship with their superintendent, (c) problems with facilities, (d) financial problems, (e) working ineffectively with a business partner, and (f) perceived unethical behavior by a business partner. Advice offered by these directors included the importance of securing and controlling finances at the site level, developing and maintaining collaborative relationships with sponsoring agents, beginning a charter school with a specific vision, not allowing a business entity to operate a charter school, and maintaining a high level of energy and enthusiasm.},

  abstract = {Recent research on the politics of contemporary policymaking has centered the contributions of diverse conservative forces. Conservatives are viewed as the chief proponents of marketizing reforms featuring retrenchment of social programs, privatization of social services, deregulation, and tax reduction, as well as of disciplining policies that impose more stringent behavioral requirements on beneficiaries, employ testing and reporting to monitor recipient performance, and impose sanctions for non-compliance. These developments are often viewed as fostering a less egalitarian politics, especially for historically disadvantaged groups.             I examine the rise of standards, testing, accountability, and limited school choice policies in federal education policymaking, which are widely viewed as embodying the same conservative interests and ideologies that have shaped policymaking in other areas. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, I show that certain civil rights organizations, not conservative forces, provided much of the impetus for federal standards, testing, and accountability reforms, which they viewed as measures for raising the achievement of disadvantaged students. Tracing the origins and consequences of these policies, my research reveals that entrepreneurial progressives can achieve significant legislative successes that they believe will accomplish progressive objectives. However, these policy victories have yielded mixed substantive results, and they have also unleashed complex and unanticipated consequences.},

Do charter schools drain resources and high-achieving peers from non-charter schools? This paper answers these questions using an empirical strategy that exploits a 2011 reform that lifted caps on charter schools for underperforming districts in Massachusetts. We use complementary synthetic control instrumental variables (IV-SC) and differences-in-differences instrumental variables (IV-DiD) estimators. The results suggest greater charter attendance increases per-pupil expenditures in traditional public schools and induces them to shift expenditure from support services to instruction and salaries. At the same time, charter expansion has a small positive effect on non-charter students’ achievement.},

  abstract = {In this article, we make two points about the ongoing debate concerning the purported increase in narcissistic tendencies in college students over the last 30 years. First, we show that when new data on narcissism are folded into preexisting meta-analytic data, there is no increase in narcissism in college students over the last few decades. Second, we show, in contrast, that age changes in narcissism are both replicable and comparatively large in comparison to generational changes in narcissism. This leads to the conclusion that every generation is Generation Me, as every generation of younger people are more narcissistic than their elders.},

  abstract = {U.S public schools are more segregated today than they have been since before the desegregation efforts that followed the 1954 Supreme Court case, Brown v. Board of Education, (Kozol, 2005, Mullins, 2013; Rothstein, 2013; Strauss, 2014; UCLA, 2014). Coinciding with this segregation are vast racial inequities and stratification, which are being intensified through the policies known as corporate education reform. In this article, we share the voices and stories of scholars and education activists who have documented the racism and segregation of U.S. public schooling over the rise of corporate education reform. We start with the current state of our segregated schools, what Jonathan Kozol refers to as “apartheid education” (Kozol, 2005). We then take a step back and look at the historical and ideological context of U.S. schooling under industrial capitalism, white supremacy and neoliberalism, all creating the perfect storm for the punitive and dehumanizing conditions within 21st century public education. We will then explore the formula of corporate education reform through an examination of specific instruments used to enact these policies: school choice and charters, high-stakes testing, and the disciplining and criminalizing of black and brown bodies. We also examine the delivery of these policies via the discourse used to justify them and the intentions behind them. Finally, we call the question of whether public schools are our best hope for achieving social and economic equity and how those working in this struggle might keep that vision in mind.},

Since its appearance in August 2019—the 400th anni- versary of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to the British colonies that would become the United States—the 1619 Project has elicited a significant backlash, culminating recently in the efforts of multiple state legislatures to ban the use of its curricular materials. Consis- tent with those efforts, this Heritage Foundation report seeks to disqualify the 1619 Project curricular materials as insufficiently celebratory of American capitalism. The report asserts that the 1619 Project overstates slavery’s importance to U.S. economic history. However, the report is less concerned with potential students’ content knowledge about slavery than with students’ receptivity to the libertarian policy preferences of the Heritage Foundation. The report states an explicit fear that the 1619 Project’s discussion of slavery will compel students to hold redistributive and regulatory economic policies in higher esteem. Discon- nected from the current scholarly literature on both American slavery and history pedagogy, the report commits the exact sin with which it besmirches the 1619 Project: substituting ideology and political motives for an accurate engagement with the past.},

  abstract = {In earlier work, I have developed the lock-in model of inequality, which compares persistent racial inequality to persistent market monopoly power. In this article, I explore the implications of applying the lock-in model to the problem of residential segregation. Here, I put forward two central arguments. First, I argue that residential segregation constitutes an example of a locked-in racial monopoly. During the days of Jim Crow, white racial cartels (e.g., homeowners’ associations and real estate boards) engaged in anti-competitive conduct to exclude blacks and monopolize access to good neighborhoods. That early neighborhood advantage has now become locked-in via certain self-reinforcing neighborhood effects, namely through public school finance and neighborhood job referral networks. Because the (white) “rich get richer” in neighborhoods with good schools and good job networks, non-whites are relatively less able to move into more expensive white neighborhoods. Second, I argue that anti-discrimination law should shift its focus from individual intent to a lock-in framework. In contrast to the individual intent model, the lock-in model suggests that the definition of discrimination be expanded, to include persistent racial inequality that can be traced historically to earlier “anti-competitive” conduct. This definition, and the lock-in model itself, bring to light the historical, institutional and collective dimensions of racial inequality that the individual intent model suppresses.},

Long after the passage of civil rights laws and now the inauguration of our first black president, blacks and Latinos possess barely a nickel of wealth for every dollar that whites have. Why have we made so little progress?Legal scholar Daria Roithmayr provocatively argues that racial inequality lives on because white advantage functions as a powerful self-reinforcing monopoly, reproducing itself automatically from generation to generation even in the absence of intentional discrimination. Drawing on work in antitrust law and a range of other disciplines, Roithmayr brilliantly compares the dynamics of white advantage to the unfair tactics of giants like AT\&T and Microsoft.With penetrating insight, Roithmayr locates the engine of white monopoly in positive feedback loops that connect the dramatic disparity of Jim Crow to modern racial gaps in jobs, housing and education. Wealthy white neighborhoods fund public schools that then turn out wealthy white neighbors. Whites with lucrative jobs informally refer their friends, who refer their friends, and so on. Roithmayr concludes that racial inequality might now be locked in place, unless policymakers immediately take drastic steps to dismantle this oppressive system.},

Despite offering valuable policy information, the liberal view is grounded in a number of indefensible positions with regard to the politics of knowledge and curriculum, neoliberal globalization, and the relationship between the political economy of schooling and broader economic and political questions. The article juxtaposes the ethical, political and cultural thought of Henry Giroux against the liberal position. It suggests that those committed to educational justice ought to re-evaluate political and cultural values in the struggles against corporate school reform so as not to follow the mistaken liberal thought and collude with the neoliberal ideology and economic doctrine that animates these destructive policies.},

Three hundred and seventy-seven articles published in English language peer-reviewed journals between 2006 and 2017 are discursively analyzed. Democratic education functions as a privileged nodal point of different political discourses. Two discourses against (elitist and neoliberal) and six discourses pro democratic education (liberal, deliberative, multiculturalist, participatory, critical, and agonistic) construct its meaning. It is argued that the different versions of democratic education respond to various (a) ontological and epistemological assumptions, (b) normative approaches to democracy, and (c) conceptions of the relationship between education and politics. For educational policy, the review provides a critique of elitist and neoliberal policies and support for participatory decision making across discourses. Recommendations for educational practice are made by identifying pedagogies across democratic education scholarship as well as specific pedagogies for each discourse.},

Interviews with 15 students revealed systematic differences in their knowledge, resources, and engagement in high school choice that help explain the disparity in the academic quality of their high school assignments.},

Tracing the global history of inequality from the Stone Age to today, Walter Scheidel shows that it never dies peacefully. The Great Leveler is the first book to chart the crucial role of violent shocks in reducing inequality over the full sweep of human history around the world. The “Four Horsemen” of leveling―mass-mobilization warfare, transformative revolutions, state collapse, and catastrophic plagues―have repeatedly destroyed the fortunes of the rich. Today, the violence that reduced inequality in the past seems to have diminished, and that is a good thing. But it casts serious doubt on the prospects for a more equal future. An essential contribution to the debate about inequality, The Great Leveler provides important new insights about why inequality is so persistent―and why it is unlikely to decline anytime soon.},

  abstract = {One major finding of the Equality of Educational Opportunity (EEO) report was that a smaller proportion of African Americans than whites reported “wanting to go no further than high school in each region of the country.” Blacks in the 1960s had high college aspirations, and those aspirations have continued, but today, as then, fewer blacks than whites attend four-y­ ear colleges. Since the EEO report, the U.S. population has become increasingly diverse, and postsecondary aspirations and enrollment now vary considerably among racial and ethnic groups. Whereas the EEO report focused on the significant role of students’ concrete knowledge about college in postsecondary attendance, it paid limited attention to variation in postsecondary preparation activities. This study contrasts earlier indicators of student college knowledge with college preparation activities to understand variations in college enrollment among different racial and ethnic groups. Results indicate that concrete knowledge has less impact on minority postsecondary enrollment than taking more-­advanced academic courses.},

She lifts the veil on how the Common Core was developed, who was present in the back room, the push to copyright it so that test-makers could profit, and the urgency for governors to sign commitments before the standards were even completed. CCSS is publicized as being a state-led, teacher-developed approach guaranteed to ensure that all students are college- and career-ready. By the end of this eye-opening book, readers will come to understand the CCSS and its attendant assessments as something very different—an education-restricting, profit-garnering opportunity packaged as an education-sounding sales pitch. Common Core Dilemma will appeal to readers across the political spectrum who want to better understand the role of corporations, nonprofits, big donors with strings attached, and the federal government in exercising control in our schools. It is essential reading for courses on education and government, and education and special interests.},

  abstract = {Background: Teaching ethics in public health programmes is not routine everywhere – at least not in most schools of public health in the European region. Yet empirical evidence shows that schools of public health are more and more interested in the integration of ethics in their curricula, since public health professionals often have to face difficult ethical decisions. Discussion: The authors have developed and practiced an approach to how ethics can be taught even in crowded curricula, requiring five to eight hours of teaching and learning contact time. In this way, if programme curricula do not allow more time for ethics, students of public health can at least be sensitised to ethics and ethical argumentation. This approach – focusing on the application of seven mid-level principles to cases (non-maleficence, beneficence, health maximisation, efficiency, respect for autonomy, justice, proportionality) – is presented in this paper. Easy to use ‘tools’ applying ethics to public health are presented. Summary: The crowded nature of the public health curriculum, and the nature of students participating in it, required us to devise and develop a short course, and to use techniques that were likely to provide a relatively efficient introduction to the processes, content and methods involved in the field of ethics.},

Observers argue that either nothing works or we don’t know what works. At the same time, the federal government is asking localities to implement evidence-based interventions. But what is known empirically about whether school improvement works, how long it takes, which policies are most effective, and which contexts respond best to intervention? We meta-analyze 141 estimates from 67 studies of turnaround policies implemented post-NCLB. On average, these policies have had a moderate positive effect on math but no effect on ELA achievement as measured by high-stakes exams. We find evidence of positive impacts on low-stakes exams in STEM and humanities subjects and no evidence of harm on non-test outcomes. Some elements of reform, namely extended learning time and teacher replacements, predict greater effects. Contexts serving majority-Latinx populations have seen the largest improvements.},

  abstract = {Philanthropists have long funded a wide range of educational research, practice, and policy initiatives, primarily through namesake foundations. Some observers have criticized these efforts as doing little to change the status quo in education and have called for more aggressive action on the part of this sector. Out of this critique has emerged a new philanthropic form, often termed venture philanthropy. Perhaps nowhere is venture philanthropy more prevalent than in the charter school and policy and advocacy terrain. Drawing from document analysis and a review of historical literature, this article provides a sociopolitical, descriptive discussion of this “new” form of philan- thropy in supporting the charter school reform network. It also examines the funding strategies of venture philanthropies and the areas of policy intersec- tion in program initiatives. The article concludes with a discussion of some political and philosophical tensions that venture philanthropy raises and also provides suggestions for further research.},

The text contains brief histories of the evolution of statistical methods and a number of brief biographies of the most famous statisticians of the 20th century. Also throughout are a few statistical jokes, puzzles, and traditional stories. The level of the Joy of Statistics is elementary and explores a variety of statistical applications using graphs and plots, along with detailed and intuitive descriptions and occasionally using a bit of 10th grade mathematics. Examples of a few of the topics are gambling games such as roulette, blackjack, and lotteries as well as more serious subjects such as comparison of black/white infant mortality rates, coronary heart disease risk, and ethnic differences in Hodgkin’s disease. The statistical description of these methods and topics are accompanied by easy to understand explanations labeled “how it works.”},

Data consist of over four million test observations of nationally representative samples of students on seven separate math and reading tests. We estimate unadjusted trends as well as trends adjusted for changes in the demographic composition of the two sectors. Compared to district cohorts, we find steeper upward trends in mean charter performance. Larger sector differentials are observed for African Americans, low SES students, and for students in the Northeast. No significant trend differences are observed for Hispanic and Asian Americans, suburban students and for students in the West. Since students in the two sectors may differ in relevant ways for reasons unrelated to demographic characteristics, inferences about changes in school production factors remain uncertain.},

Since 1969, NAEP has been a common measure of student achievement across the country in mathematics, reading, science, and many other subjects. Depending on the assessment, NAEP report cards provide national, state, and some district-level results, as well as results for different demographic groups. NAEP is a congressionally mandated project of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), located within the U.S. Department of Education’s Institute of Education Sciences. NAEP data are also used in special studies conducted by NCES. These have included comparisons of proficiency standards across state assessments; insights from high school transcripts, including courses taken and credits earned; and in-depth looks at how different demographic groups perform across different types of schools. The National Assessment Governing Board, an independent, bipartisan organization made up of governors, state school superintendents, teachers, researchers, and representatives of the general public, sets policy for NAEP.},

  abstract = {In many school districts, the pressure to raise test scores has created overnight celebrity status for formative assessment. Its powers to raise student achievement have been touted, however, without attending to the research on which these claims were based. Sociocultural learning theory provides theoretical grounding for understanding how formative assessment works to increase student learning. The articles in this special issue bring us back to underlying first principles by offering separate validity frameworks for evaluating formative assessment (Nichols, Meyers, \& Burling) and newly-invented interim assessments (Perie, Marion, \& Gong). The article by Heritage, Kim, Vendlinski, and Herman then offers the most important insight of all; that is, formative assessment is of little use if teachers don’t know what to do when students are unable to grasp an important concept. While it is true that validity investigations are needed, I argue that the validity research that will tell us the most—about how formative assessment can be used to improve student learning—must be embedded in rich curriculum and must at the same time attempt to foster instructional practices consistent with learning research.},

AI4SG has received lots of attention from the research community in the past decade with several successful applications. Building on the most comprehensive collection of the AI4SG literature to date with over 1000 contributed papers, we provide a detailed account and analysis of the work under the theme in the following ways. (1) We quantitatively analyze the distribution and trend of the AI4SG literature in terms of application domains and AI techniques used. (2) We propose three conceptual methods to systematically group the existing literature and analyze the eight AI4SG application domains in a uni ed framework. (3) We distill ve research topics that represent the common challenges in AI4SG across various application domains. (4) We discuss ve issues that, we hope, can shed light on the future development of the AI4SG research.},

We provide a comprehensive description of how individual reforms affected resource allocation to lowand high-income districts within states. We then examine whether characteristics of the SFR, such as the funding formula that was adopted, predict effect size heterogeneity. Taken together, this research aims to provide a rich description of variation in states’ responses to SFRs, as well as explanation of this heterogeneity as it relates to contextual factors.},

  abstract = {The Sokal affair, also called the Sokal hoax, was a demonstrative scholarly hoax performed by Alan Sokal, a physics professor at New York University and University College London. In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to Social Text, an academic journal of postmodern cultural studies. The submission was an experiment to test the journal's intellectual rigor, and specifically to investigate whether "a leading North American journal of cultural studies—whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross—[would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions".The article, "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity", was published in the magazine Social Text spring/summer 1996 "Science Wars" issue. It proposed that quantum gravity is a social and linguistic construct. At that time, the journal did not practice academic peer review and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist. Three weeks after its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in the magazine Lingua Franca that the article was a hoax.The hoax caused controversy about the scholarly merit of commentary on the physical sciences by those in the humanities; the influence of postmodern philosophy on social disciplines in general; academic ethics, including whether Sokal was wrong to deceive the editors and readers of Social Text; and whether Social Text had exercised appropriate intellectual rigor.},

This systematic review of trends in the charter school research over the last decade helps determine where empirical evidence exists and where new research is necessary. Findings reveal that student and school outcomes are the most common topics studied; however, a dearth of national, longitudinal research limits generalizability. Furthermore, the scope of the research was rather limited: most research examined a single state, district, or school. The article concludes with a discussion of possible new directions for research on charter schools.},

This makes it hard to keep up with state-of-the-art and to be at the forefront of research, as well as to assess the collective evidence in a particular area of business research. This is why the literature review as a research method is more relevant than ever. Traditional literature reviews often lack thoroughness and rigor and are conducted ad hoc, rather than following a specific methodology. Therefore, questions can be raised about the quality and trustworthiness of these types of reviews. This paper discusses literature review as a methodology for conducting research and offers an overview of different types of reviews, as well as some guidelines to how to both conduct and evaluate a literature review paper. It also discusses common pitfalls and how to get literature reviews published.},

  abstract = {Recent causal evidence connects levels of per pupil spending and short- and long-term student outcomes. This evidence further suggests that specific types of spending may mediate the relationship between expenditures and student outcomes. Yet race remains related to funding disparities and schooling experiences in ways that raise concerns about the role of school finance in perpetuating racial opportunity gaps. We explore this potential source of educational inequality by asking how racial segregation and racial socioeconomic disparities are related to racial disparities in school district spending over time. We use 15 years of data from the School Funding Fairness Data System on school district expenditures and demographics to explore patterns of racial/ethnic segregation and racial/ethnic disparities across six categories of per pupil expenditures. We find that changes in racial/ethnic segregation within a state from 1999 through 2013 are associated with racial/ethnic disparities in spending, even after accounting for disparities in poverty.},

  abstract = {The Big Five personality traits have been linked to dozens of life outcomes. However, metascientific research has raised questions about the replicability of behavioral science. The Life Outcomes of Personality Replication (LOOPR) Project was therefore conducted to estimate the replicability of the personality-outcome literature. Specifically, I conducted preregistered, high-powered (median N = 1,504) replications of 78 previously published trait–outcome associations. Overall, 87\% of the replication attempts were statistically significant in the expected direction. The replication effects were typically 77\% as strong as the corresponding original effects, which represents a significant decline in effect size. The replicability of individual effects was predicted by the effect size and design of the original study, as well as the sample size and statistical power of the replication. These results indicate that the personality-outcome literature provides a reasonably accurate map of trait–outcome associations but also that it stands to benefit from efforts to improve replicability.},

It can be concluded that the use of WhatsApp is necessary and beneficial to the teacher's work, but the boundaries must be examined and defined in the use of the WhatsApp groups.},

  abstract = {Men and women score similarly in most areas of mathematics, but a gap favoring men is consistently found at the high end of performance. One explanation for this gap, stereotype threat, was first proposed by Spencer, Steele, and Quinn (1999) and has received much attention. We discuss merits and shortcomings of this study and review replication attempts. Only 55\% of the articles with experimental designs that could have replicated the original results did so. But half of these were confounded by statistical adjustment of preexisting mathematics exam scores. Of the unconfounded experiments, only 30\% replicated the original. A meta-analysis of these effects confirmed that only the group of studies with adjusted mathematics scores displayed the stereotype threat effect. We conclude that although stereotype threat may affect some women, the existing state of knowledge does not support the current level of enthusiasm for this as a mechanism underlying the gender gap in mathematics. We argue there are many reasons to close this gap, and that too much weight on the stereotype explanation may hamper research and implementation of effective interventions.},

Both evaluations were nationally significant, had to be conducted quickly, were politically volatile, were keyed to professional standards, and had substantial impacts. However, the latter evaluation went sour, whereas the former received an official commendation. Evaluators should do all they can to demonstrate to clients that sound evaluations are not to be feared, but should be valued and used. An investigation of what went right and wrong in these evaluations identified contracting as a key variable. This article advises evaluators and clients to regularly negotiate clear, sound contracts before proceeding with an evaluation, and presents a checklist to assist in the contracting process.},

  urldate = {2022-06-23},
  abstract = {The Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 (ESSA) provided states with increased flexibility to design school accountability systems. A core element of the law is the requirement that states develop statewide systems allowing for meaningful differentiation among schools, and use this information to identify schools that should be the focus of improvement efforts. Individual states decide on the type of report card, or rating system, that they will use to report this information to the public.  A core premise of state school report cards is that publicizing information about how well schools and districts meet specified goals will incentivize school improvement. However, for report card rating systems to be potentially beneficial as a school improvement policy instrument, they must provide fair and valid indicators of school performance. The increased flexibility under ESSA means that states are following different policy paths reflecting their own interests, concerns, political perspectives, and economic conditions. While states may take different approaches to measuring and reporting school performance, they have consistently adopted school report cards that collapse multiple school performance indicators into a summative rating. This is concerning because there is very limited credible research on how well a single score captures the complexity of school performance or provides information on how to improve. Summative ratings that conflate information into a single score obscure a great deal of information about variations in school performance. They also do little to explain performance differences between or within schools or to help identify effective strategies to address low performance. Moreover, the available research evidence suggests that summative ratings fail to identify schools with high and equitable achievement, distinguishing such schools from those with high average achievement and large achievement gaps. Indeed, available research suggests that summative ratings advantage schools serving primarily higher income students while obscuring the failure of such schools to serve all children. ESSA’s so-called Fifth Indicator provision allows states more flexibility to incorporate a more nuanced understanding of local contexts by adding another indicator—typically attendance, social emotional, or school climate measures. But this addition has not produced a system capturing the complexity of teaching and learning. This means that policymakers face significant challenges in designing accountability systems that take into account differences in school processes, capacity, resources, and socioeconomic variables. It is, therefore, recommended that federal policymakers take the following four steps: • Require that states conduct rigorous evaluations of their existing performance rating systems to determine the reliability, validity, and fairness of their summative ratings. • Fund research on state accountability rating systems that identifies system components capable of yielding valid inferences about school performance. • Adopt social and economic policies that address out-of-school variables that are substantially related to school performance, such as policies that increase access to health care, address the concentration of disadvantage or advantage in different neighborhoods, and expand the availability of housing and employment opportunities. • Design federal accountability policy that promotes equitable accountability systems among states, given the reality that state political and economic variables shape divergent state systems. Even without federal action, state policymakers can take the following two steps: • Evaluate state accountability systems to ensure they are not misidentifying schools and potentially leading to the misappropriation of resources for school improvement. • Adopt education, social, and economic policies that promote equitable education and address out-of-school variables related to school performance.},

Exploring theory and practice, this Element attempts to provide one-stop shopping for those who are new to the area and for those who are familiar with it. With reference to nudges, taxes, mandates, and bans, it offers concrete examples of behaviorally informed policies. It also engages the fundamental questions, including the proper analysis of human welfare in light of behavioral findings. It offers a plea for respecting freedom of choice – so long as people’s choices are adequately informed and free from behavioral biases.},

  abstract = {The 2018 edition of the Digest of Education Statistics is the 54th in a series of publications initiated in 1962. The Digest has been issued annually except for combined editions for the years 1977–78, 1983–84, and 1985–86. Its primary purpose is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from prekindergarten through graduate school. The Digest includes a selection of data from many sources, both government and private, and draws especially on the results of surveys and activities carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). To qualify for inclusion in the Digest, material must be nationwide in scope and of current interest and value. The publication contains information on a variety of subjects in the field of education statistics, including the number of schools and colleges, teachers, enrollments, and graduates, in addition to data on educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, libraries, and international comparisons. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provides background for evaluating education data. Although the Digest contains important information on federal education funding, more detailed information on federal activities is available from federal education program offices.},

  abstract = {A recent report, Charter Schools and the Achievement Gap, finds that, though charter schools on average perform no better than traditional public schools, urban “no-excuses” charter schools—which often use intensive discipline to enforce order—demonstrate promising re- sults. It recommends that these schools and their practices be widely replicated within and outside of the charter school sector. We find three major flaws with this conclusion. First, the report’s recommendations are based solely on the academic success of these schools and fail to address the controversy over their use of harsh disciplinary methods. No-excuses dis- ciplinary practices can contribute to high rates of exclusionary discipline (e.g., suspensions that push students out of school) and may not support a broad definition of student success. Second, the recommendation that schools replicate no-excuses practices begs the question of what exactly should be replicated. It does not confront the lack of research identifying which school practices are effective for improving student achievement. Third, the report does not address many of the underlying factors that would allow no-excuses schools and their practices to successfully replicate, such as additional resources, committed teachers, and students and families willing and able to abide by these schools’ stringent practices. Thus, while the report is nuanced in its review of charter school impacts, it lacks this same care in drawing its conclusions—greatly decreasing the usefulness of the report.},

  abstract = {This bibliography is an attempt to list the most relevant material on the topic of ‘social entrepreneurship’ published within the past two decades. The Academic Search Complete and Web of Science databases were used to conduct a literature search using the keywords ‘social enterprise’, ‘social entrepreneurship’ and ‘social entrepreneur’. The literature search was limited to peer-reviewed journal articles and books published between 1989 and 2009. Since academic interest in social entrepreneurship is a relatively new phenomenon, very little research in this area was conducted before 1989. Two seminal pre-1989 articles were included in this list: Banks (1972), who first coined the term ‘social entrepreneur’ in the context of the sociology of social movements; and Drucker (1979), who first introduced the concept of ‘social enterprise’ while advocating ethical responsibilities of corporations. Only articles and books in which ‘social entrepreneurship’, ’social enterprises’ or ‘social entrepreneurs’ were the main focus and had an important role in either the formulation of an empirical study or the development of a conceptual framework were included in this list. Articles that merely mentioned these terms or in which these concepts did not play a major role were not included. Mention may be made of online resources, such as technical reports, unpublished manuscripts, conference papers and white papers. All but two such articles, Dees (2001) and Alter (2004), were excluded from this list. The artcile by Dees (2001) titled, ‘The meaning of “social entrepreneurship”’, is a significant conceptual contribution to the field and has been cited 211 times since its publication online. Alter’s article (2004) that presents a typology of social enterprises is yet another important theoretical contribution and has been cited 35 times since it was published online.             It is hoped that this systematic and thorough listing of relevant work in the area of social entrepreneurship will be of assistance to scholars in a field in which the literature, to date, has been fragmented and disjointed. It will be much appreciated if the unintentional omission of any relevant articles and books is brought to the attention of the author.},

However, using large samples of U.S. high-school seniors from 1976 to 2006 (Total N = 477,380), we found little evidence of meaningful change in egotism, self-enhancement, individualism, self-esteem, locus of control, hopelessness, happiness, life satisfaction, loneliness, antisocial behavior, time spent working or watching television, political activity, the importance of religion, and the importance of social status over the last 30 years. Today's youth are less fearful of social problems than previous generations and they are also more cynical and less trusting. In addition, today's youth have higher educational expectations than previous generations. However, an inspection of effect sizes provided little evidence for strong or widespread cohort-linked changes.},

What can be done to ensure that future education research is more effective in this respect? This paper describes the significant disconnect between education researchers and policymakers, characterized by three problems: (1) researchers do not inform policymakers about the results of their research, (2) policymakers do not inform researchers about their policy goals, and (3) when policymakers and researchers do exchange information, they often do so in a highly political context in which many interests supersede the interests of students. However, important changes since the Coleman Report have created a context more conducive to effective collaboration, including a nationwide movement among researchers, policymakers, and funders to create more meaningful and effective partnerships. These changes present a unique opportunity for improving the connection between research and policy and reducing educational inequities over the next fifty years.},

  abstract = {This first report of an ongoing evaluation of The Wallace Foundation’s Principal Pipeline Initiative describes the six participating school districts’ plans and activities during the first year of their grants. The evaluation, conducted by Policy Studies Associates and the RAND Corporation, is intended to inform policy makers and practitioners about the process of carrying out new policies and practices for school leadership and about the results of investments in the Principal Pipeline Initiative. This report is based on collection and analysis of qualitative data, including the districts’ proposals, work plans, and progress reports and semi-structured interviews in spring 2012 with 91 administrators employed by districts and their partner institutions. Leaders in all districts report wanting to enlarge their pools of strong applicants for principal positions and to identify and cultivate leadership talent as early as possible in educators’ careers. Districts are actively working on all required pipeline components: (1) with stakeholder participation, they have developed standards and identified competencies for principals, which they plan to use to guide principal training, hiring, evaluation, and support; (2) they are initiating or strengthening partnerships with university training programs; (3) for hiring, they have standard performance tasks and are developing systems to capture data on candidates’ experience; (4) they have diagnostic evaluation tools and are working to build the capacity of principal supervisors and mentors to support principals’ skill development. In addition, all are also bolstering district-run training programs for graduates of university training programs who aspire to become principals.},

Confounding by campus may explain the discrepancy. Study 1 updates a nationwide meta-analysis of college students' scores on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) and controls for campus ( k = 107; N = 49,818). In Study 2, the authors examine NPI scores among the students on one university campus, the University of South Alabama, between 1994 and 2009 ( N = 4,152). Both studies demonstrate significant increases in narcissism over time (Study 1\, d = .37, 1982–2008, when campus is controlled; Study 2\, d = .37, 1994–2009). These results support a generational differences model of individual personality traits reflecting changes in culture.},

Five data sets show a generational increase in narcissism, including one that demonstrates significant increases when a confound is controlled. College and child samples increase in self-esteem over the generations. Some high school samples show no change, though high school students increasingly embrace other overly positive self-views. In nationally representative samples of high school and college students, values have shifted toward extrinsic (money, fame, and image) concerns and away from intrinsic (community, affiliation) concerns. These trends have mostly negative consequences, such as lower empathy, less concern for others, and less civic engagement (e.g., interest in social issues, government, and politics). Parents and teachers should focus on teaching children and adolescents the values of hard work and consideration for others instead of an inflated sense of self.},

In return, they are held strictly accountable for their academic and financial performance. To represent what such flexibility and accountability look like in practice, this guide provides a glimpse into the inner workings of eight American charter schools whose freedom to experiment is raising the level of student learning.},

It focuses on three questions: (1) Do children experience higher achievement gains in private school? (2) If so, is this because private schools are more productive? (3) Does competition from private schools raise public school productivity and/or otherwise affect those “left behind”? The chapter shows that unless each of these questions is answered, one cannot form a full assessment on the desirability of private school entry. Voucher experiments suggest that question 1 can be answered in the affirmative for some subgroups and in some contexts. Such work cannot typically isolate channels, however, and hence does not address question 2. Question 3 has been primarily studied by papers on large-scale voucher programs. These suggest that private school entry results in nonrandom sorting of students, but are less clear on the effects. The bottom line is that despite demand for clear, simple conclusions on the effects of competition from private schools, research does not yet provide these.},

  abstract = {Notwithstanding evidence to the contrary, a major myth lingers that Mexican Americans, particularly parents oflow-socioeconomic status background, do not value education. As a consequence, the myth asserts, Mexican American children experience poor academic achievement. We examine this myth in 3 ways. First, we suggest that the basis for the myth lies in the pseudoscientific notion of "deficit thinking," a mind-set molded by the fusion of ideology and science that blames the victim, rather than holding oppressive and inequitable schooling arrangements culpable. Second, we explore the course of the mythmaking itself. In doing so, we examine several sources (e.g., early master's theses; published scholarly literature, particularly from the "cultural deprivation" and "at risk" child categories). Third, we provide discourse on how the myth can be debunked. This is done by providing strong evidence that Mexican Americans do indeed value education. Our evidentiary forms are (a) the Mexican American people's long-standing struggle for equal educational opportunity, (b) the scholarly literature documenting parental involvement, and (c) a case study of transgenerational parental involvement.},

An analysis of its proof reveals use of an incorrect statistical assumption. The assumption does not invalidate the theorem itself though, which can be shown to follow directly from the discrete nature of the equating problem it addresses. But, surprisingly, an obvious relaxation of the problem is enough to obtain exactly the opposite result: As long as two test forms measure the same ability, they can always be equated, no matter their reliability, degree of parallelness, or even difference in length. Also, in spite of its lack of validity, the original proof of Lord’s theorem has an important interim result directly applicable to the problem of assembling a new test form pre-equated to an old form.},

  abstract = {The increasing inequality in income and wealth in recent years, and the associated excessive pay packages of CEOs in the US and elsewhere, is of growing concern among policy makers as well as the common person. However, there seems to be no satisfactory answer, in conventional economic theories and models, to the fundamental questions of what kind of income distribution we ought to see, at least under ideal conditions, in a free market environment, and whether this distribution is fair. We propose a novel microeconomic game theoretic framework that addresses these questions and proves that the lognormal distribution is the fairest inequality of pay in an organization comprising of homogeneous agents, under ideal free market conditions at equilibrium. We also show that for a population of two different classes of agents, the equilibrium distribution is a combination of two different lognormal distributions where one of them, corresponding to the top ∼3–5\% of the population, can be misidentified as a Pareto distribution. We compare our predictions with empirical data on global income inequality trends provided by Piketty and others. Our analysis suggests that the Scandinavian countries, and to a lesser extent Switzerland, Netherlands and Australia, have managed to get close to the ideal distribution for the bottom ∼99\% of the population, while the US and UK remain less fair at the other extreme. Other European countries such as France and Germany, and Japan and Canada, are in the middle. Our theory also shows the deep and direct connection between potential game theory and statistical mechanics through entropy, which we identify as a measure of fairness in a distribution. This leads us to propose the fair market hypothesis, that the self-organizing dynamics of the ideal free market, i.e., Adam Smith’s ‘‘invisible hand’’, not only promotes efficiency but also maximizes fairness under the given constraints.},

  abstract = {We replicated and extended Shoda, Mischel, and Peake’s (1990) famous marshmallow study, which showed strong bivariate correlations between a child’s ability to delay gratification just before entering school and both adolescent achievement and socioemotional behaviors. Concentrating on children whose mothers had not completed college, we found that an additional minute waited at age 4 predicted a gain of approximately one tenth of a standard deviation in achievement at age 15. But this bivariate correlation was only half the size of those reported in the original studies and was reduced by two thirds in the presence of controls for family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment. Most of the variation in adolescent achievement came from being able to wait at least 20 s. Associations between delay time and measures of behavioral outcomes at age 15 were much smaller and rarely statistically significant.},

  abstract = {It is well known that a staged interpreter is a compiler: specializing an interpreter to a given program produces an equivalent executable that runs faster. This connection is known as the first Futamura projection. It is even more widely known that an abstract interpreter is a program analyzer: tweaking an interpreter to run on abstract domains produces a sound static analysis. What happens when we combine these two ideas, and apply specialization to an abstract interpreter?             In this paper, we present a unifying framework that naturally extends the first Futamura projection from concrete interpreters to abstract interpreters. Our approach derives a sound staged abstract interpreter based on a generic interpreter with type-level binding-time abstractions and monadic abstractions. By using different instantiations of these abstractions, the generic interpreter can flexibly behave in one of four modes: as an unstaged concrete interpreter, a staged concrete interpreter, an unstaged abstract interpreter, or a staged abstract interpreter. As an example of abstraction without regret, the overhead of these abstraction layers is eliminated in the generated code after staging. We show that staging abstract interpreters is practical and useful to optimize static analysis, all while requiring less engineering effort and without compromising soundness. We conduct three case studies, including a comparison with Boucher and Feeley’s abstract compilation, applications to various control-flow analyses, and a demonstration for modular analysis. We also empirically evaluate the effect of staging on the execution time. The experiment shows an order of magnitude speedup with staging for control-flow analyses.},

But relying on intuition may be a bad idea for teachers and learners alike.   This accessible guide helps teachers to integrate effective, research-backed strategies for learning into their classroom practice. The book explores exactly what constitutes good evidence for effective learning and teaching strategies, how to make evidence-based judgments instead of relying on intuition, and how to apply findings from cognitive psychology directly to the classroom.  Including real-life examples and case studies, FAQs, and a wealth of engaging illustrations to explain complex concepts and emphasize key points, the book is divided into four parts:    Evidence-based education and the science of learning Basics of human cognitive processes Strategies for effective learning Tips for students, teachers, and parents.   Written by "The Learning Scientists" and fully illustrated by Oliver Caviglioli, Understanding How We Learn is a rejuvenating and fresh examination of cognitive psychology's application to education. This is an essential read for all teachers and educational practitioners, designed to convey the concepts of research to the reality of a teacher's classroom.},

Charter school reform allows groups of parents, educators, and entrepreneurs to create more independent schools, free from many state and local regulations. The purpose of this two-and-a-half year study was to examine many of the most prominent claims of charter school advocates against the day-to-day experiences of educators, parents, and stu- dents in charter schools as well as in nearby public schools. We conducted case studies of 17 charter schools in 10 school districts across the state. We sampled for diversity at both the district and school level in order to capture the range of experiences within this reform movement. While charter reform as a public policy tool prescribes no particular school-level practice or singular reform strategy, it is appealing to educators and policy makers due to claims about how charter reform families, particularly those who traditionally have had the will spur much-needed change throughout the public system.},

  abstract = {School districts around the country have launched new reform strategies that are designed to expand autonomy for public schools, often called “Innovation Schools.” Pursuant to these state- and local-level plans to create more autonomous schools, school leaders are granted greater  amounts  of  authority  over  school  operations  such  as  curriculum,  budgeting,  and  hiring, while districts continue to manage services related to teacher payroll and benefits. Compared to traditional district schools, these schools operate with greater levels of auton-omy, similar to that of charter schools that function outside district systems. Important dif-ferences exist, however, when autonomous schools are organized within districts, as these arrangements  can  ideally  improve  educational  quality  via  autonomy  without  abandoning  structures for democratic participation. This type of autonomy-based school improvement plan  also  has  limitations,  as  they  shift  a  host  of  responsibilities  (and  often  blame)  for  the  education of children from districts to individual schools and school leaders. In  this  brief,  we  consider  two  questions  about  these  reforms:  As  systemic  inequities  per-sist in the form of deepening poverty, racism, segregation, and unequal funding in schools and in society, what supports and conditions should districts provide to ensure that school leaders and educators are empowered, rather than beleaguered, in their efforts to improve the  quality  of  education  for  their  students?  What  role  should  districts  play  to  ensure  that  decentralized  management  and  decision-making  leads  to  greater  democratic  participation  and community engagement on the part of local stakeholders? We use an equity framework informed by critical theories of race and education policy and the  role  of  districts  as  institutional  actors  in  advancing  achievement  and  equity  in  public  education.  We  highlight  examples  of  state  and  district  initiatives  that  rely  on  school-level autonomy autonomy as a primary improvement strategy, focusing on in-district models. We summa-rize what we learned about the various designs of in-district autonomous schools in different states and districts, their impact on student performance and equity compared to each other and compared to non-district and traditional models, and the challenges they face in light of widening racial inequality and the need for community input and support.},

  abstract = {Just ten years ago, the only data available on the impact of school vouchers came from a poorly designed public-choice program conducted during the 1960s in Alum Rock, California. But the early and mid-1990s brought new privately and pub- licly funded voucher programs to cities such as Mil- waukee; Dayton; Cleveland; Indianapolis; San Anto- nio; Washington, D.C.; and New York City. With them came a wealth of new research opportunities. The privately funded voucher programs in New York City, Dayton, and the District of Columbia are especially conducive to study. In each city, vouchers were awarded randomly, generating treatment and control groups that are statistically indistinguish- able from one another. Before conducting the lot- teries, our evaluation team collected data on stu- dent test scores and family background characteristics. One and two years later, we retested the students. Since the two groups of students—the lottery’s winners and losers—had similar average abilities and family backgrounds, any subsequent achievement differences observed between them can e attributed to the effects of the vouchers. As a result, our evaluations of the New York, Dayton, and D.C. voucher programs have yielded the best available information on students’ test-score outcomes and parental assessments of public and pri- vate schools. Here we use the data from all three cities to analyze the one- and two-year effects on acade- mic performance of switching from a public to a pri- vate school. We find that vouchers have a moderately large, positive effect on the achievement of African- American students, but no discernible effect on the performance of students of other ethnicities.},

  abstract = {Psychology and economics are powerful sources of expert knowledge in contemporary governance. Social and emotional learning (SEL) is becoming a priority in education policy in many parts of the world. Based on the enumeration of students’ ‘noncognitive’ skills, SEL consists of a ‘psycho-economic’ combination of psychometrics with economic analysis, and is producing novel forms of statistical ‘psychodata’ about students. Constituted by an expanding infrastructure of technologies, metrics, people, money and policies, SEL has travelled transnationally through the advocacy of psychologists, economists, and behavioural scientists, with support from think tank coalitions, philanthropies, software companies, investment schemes, and international organizations. The article examines the emerging SEL infrastructure, identifying how psychological and economics experts are producing policy-relevant scientific knowledge and statistical psychodata to influence the direction of SEL policies. It examines how the OECD Study on Social and Emotional Skills, a largescale computer-based assessment, makes ‘personality’ an international focus for policy intervention and ‘human capital’ formation, thereby translating measurable socio-emotional indicators into predicted socio-economic outcomes. The SEL measurement infrastructure instantiates psychological governance within education, one underpinned by a political rationality in which society is measured effectively through scientific fact-finding and subjects are managed affectively through psychological intervention.},

In contrast, high school graduation effects are predictive of earnings effects throughout the distribution of school quality.

  abstract = {This study is about the categorisation of people in educational settings. It is clearly positioned from the perspective of the person categorised, and is particularly concerned with the violations involved when the error components of such categorisations are made invisible. Such categorisations are important. The study establishes the centrality of the measurement of educational standards to the production and control of the individual in society, and indicates the destabilising effect of doubts about the accuracy of such categorisations. Educational measurement is based on the notion of error, yet both the literature and practice of educational assessment trivialises that error. The study examines in detail how this trivialisation and obfuscation is accomplished.},

L A TEX provides the \textbackslash author, \textbackslash title and \textbackslash date commands for specifying the author, title, and date of a work. The \textbackslash maketitle command is then used to print these. If the document is more like a book or a report than an article there is a temptation to use a titlepage environment and \textbackslash maketitle to print the title page. However, there are many designs for title pages other than that provided by \textbackslash maketitle, and it may be advantageous to define your own rather than relying on the default which, I think, is more suited for an article than any substantive work.},

However, charter schools get significantly better performance on high school language arts tests. Minority and lowincome students perform better at charter schools than traditional public schools, especially at the middle school level. Minorities in middle schools perform even better at CMOs than independent charter schools.},

The study utilized focus group and individual interviews to collect data from high school students who have experienced their charter high school closing and have transitioned into a single charter high school. Data analyses were done concurrently with data collection, and the first- and second-level codes were presented in matrix displays. Four themes emerged from the interviews of these participants. These themes were: sense of belonging, fear of the unknown, being powerless, and student voice. Through the completion of the study, the researcher was able to contribute to the understanding of the experience of displaced high school students as they transitioned to their new school.

  abstract = {The term 'community school' refers to a type of publicly funded school in the United States that serves as both an educational institution and a centre of community life. A community school is both a place and a set of partnerships between the school and other community resources. Its integrated focus on academics, youth development, family support, health and social services and community development leads to improved student learning, stronger families and healthier communities. Using public schools as hubs, community schools bring together many partners to offer a range of support and opportunities to children, youth, families and communities—before, during and after school, and on weekends. According to the Coalition for Community Schools, a branch of the Institute for Educational Leadership, a community school is "both a place and a set of partnerships between the school and other community resources" with an integrated focus on academics, health and social services, leadership, and community engagement. Community schools are generally public, i.e. government and tax-payer funded, though many private and charter schools have also adopted the model. One of the difficulties the movement has encountered is the sheer diversity of institutions claiming to be community schools. This, coupled with the decentralized structure of American education, has hampered efforts to quantify the number of community schools nationally extant. The movement gained momentum in the Chicago area, where the Federation for Community Schools is working to disseminate the model throughout the public-school infrastructure. With the appointment of Arne Duncan, former CEO of Chicago Public Schools, to the post of Secretary of Education, by President Obama, the concept of "schools as centers of community life" became a part of the national education agenda during Obama's tenure. Currently, many local, state, and national organizations seek the establishment of community schools throughout the country. Of these the most prominent non-profits are the Coalition for Community Schools, Communities In Schools, Schools of the 21st Century (an initiative of Yale University), the National Community Education Association (NCEA), and the Children's Aid Society. The United States government (through the 21st Century Community Learning Center) and various state governments also provide funding and policy support for community school initiatives.},

Despite being one of the most frequently used qualitative research methodologies in educational research, the methodologists do not have a full consensus on the design and implementation of case study, which hampers its full evolution. Focusing on the landmark works of three prominent methodologists, namely Robert Yin, Sharan Merriam, Robert Stake, I attempt to scrutinize the areas where their perspectives diverge, converge and complement one another in varying dimensions of case study research. I aim to help the emerging researchers in the field of education familiarize themselves with the diverse views regarding case study that lead to a vast array of techniques and strategies, out of which they can come up with a combined perspective which best serves their research purpose.},

Various forms of capital nurtured through cultural wealth include aspirational, navigational, social, linguistic, familial and resistant capital. These forms of capital draw on the knowledges Students of Color bring with them from their homes and communities into the classroom. This CRT approach to education involves a commitment to develop schools that acknowledge the multiple strengths of Communities of Color in order to serve a larger purpose of struggle toward social and racial justice.},

They can also cut expenditures in other areas such as instructional programs and materials, transportation, or non-teaching personnel, but they risk losing support fromparents and community members who want to maintain high-quality options for students. There is a growing body of research showing that boards, superintendents, and teachers’ unions (alone and as they interact with one another) are highly influential in the decisions school districts make when they allocate resources. However, there is currently no clear understanding of what in practice defines a “powerful” school board, superintendent, or teachers’ union, nor is it widely understood how each uses political power to influence district decision-making.},

  abstract = {Background \& Purpose               This article focuses on the growing role of venture philanthropy in shaping policy and practice in teacher education in the United States. Our goal is to bring a greater level of transparency to private influences on public policy and to promote greater discussion and debate in the public arena about alternative solutions to current problems. In this article, we focus on the role of one of the most influential private groups in the United States that invests in education, the New Schools Venture Fund (NSVF), in promoting deregulation and market-based policies.                                         Research Design               We examine the changing role of philanthropy in education and the role of the NSVF in developing and promoting a bill in the U.S. Congress (the GREAT Act) that would create a system throughout the nation of charter teacher and principal preparation programs called academies. In assessing the wisdom of the GREAT Act, we examine the warrant for claims that education schools have failed in their mission to educate teachers well and the corresponding narrative that entrepreneurial programs emanating from the private sector are the solution.                                         Conclusions               We reject both the position that the status quo in teacher education is acceptable (a position held by what we term “defenders”) and the position that the current system needs to be “blown up” and replaced by a market economy (“reformers”). We suggest a third position (“transformers”) that we believe will strengthen the U.S. system of public teacher education and provide everyone's children with high-quality teachers. We conclude with a call for more trenchant dialogue about the policy options before us and for greater transparency about the ways that private interests are influencing public policy and practice in teacher education.},

The case requires the reader to propose fiscal alternatives to a school board. For example, the case might invite the reader to consider the appointment of an emergency financial manager, implement a “reduction in force” strategy, or declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy as part of an overarching plan to achieve fiscal stability. Through the case experience, students will become familiar with the actions available to educational leaders working within a fiscally distressed school district, as well as the political consequences that these actions have for a variety of stakeholders.},

Our experiments on Intel's Optane DIMMs show that DPTree reduces PM writes by a factor of 1.7x-3x compare to state-of-the-art counterparts.

  abstract = {Our goal in this effort is to create a model charter public school law that is grounded in principle, flexible enough to serve in a wide variety of state policy environments, and well-supported by research. As a whole, the model law is most applicable to the seven states without charter school laws (Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and West Virginia) and to the seven states with very weak charter school laws, most of which have a relatively small number of charter schools, students, and authorizers (Alaska, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming). Even in these 14 states, though, the model law’s provisions need to be vetted and modified to align with relevant state constitutional provisions, case law, and state context. In the other 36 states and D.C., the focus should be less on applying the model law wholesale and more on using it as a resource to tackle outstanding challenges in the charter school movements in these states, such as funding and facilities. Most of these states already have a long history of chartering that has evolved from and within the unique context of each state and boast growing numbers of charter schools, students, and authorizers. It is also important to note that a strong charter school law is a necessary but insufficient factor in driving positive results for charter schools. Twenty‐five years of experience with charter schools across the country has shown that there are five primary ingredients of a successful charter school environment in a state, as demonstrated by strong student results:   • Supportive laws and regulations (both what is on the books and how it is implemented)   • Quality authorizers   • Effective charter support organizations, such as state charter school associations and resource centers   • Outstanding school leaders and teachers   • Engaged parents and community members While it is critical to get the law right, it is equally critical to ensure these additional ingredients exist within a state’s charter school movement.},

  abstract = {This tenth edition of "Measuring up to the Model: A Ranking of State Charter School Laws" presents the latest activity in charter public school legislation across the country. This report evaluates each state's public charter school law against the 21 essential components of a strong charter school law. These 21 components are drawn from the National Alliance's "A New Model Law for Supporting the Growth of High-Quality Public Charter Schools: Second Edition." Key takeaways include: (1) For the fourth year in a row, Indiana has the nation's strongest charter school law in the country, ranking No. 1 (out of 44); (2) Georgia made the biggest jump in this year's rankings, moving up 11 spots from No. 27 to No. 16; (3) New York experienced the largest drop in this year's rankings, falling from No. 14 to No. 17; (4) The Top 10 includes a mixture of states with more mature movements (Indiana at No. 1, Colorado at No. 2, Minnesota at No. 4, Florida at No. 7, D.C. at No. 9, and Nevada at No. 10) and states with newer movements (Washington at No. 3, Alabama at No. 5, Mississippi at No. 6, and Maine at No. 8); (5) States that are enacting laws for the first time and states that are overhauling their laws are bypassing states that were previously more highly ranked, such as Arizona, Louisiana, and New York; and (6) Maryland has the nation's weakest charter school law, ranking No. 44 (out of 44). The purpose of the analyses is to encourage state laws and regulations to require best practices and guarantee charter school rights and freedoms so that state charter school movements will benefit from a supportive legal and policy environment.

In this article, we use data from an anonymous major urban school district to examine whether we see exit patterns consistent with the claim that charter schools are more likely to push out low-achieving students than are traditional public schools (TPSs). Overall, we find no empirical evidence to support the notion of push-out.},

More specifically, this study aimed to determine whether students experience joy in learning and if so, how do they experience it and when do they experience it? Two fundamental goals drove the collection of the data and subsequent data analysis. Those goals were: that participation in the LiD programme would increase student engagement, and further to that, that through increased engagement a sense of joy in learning would be experienced. The participants were from a convenience sample of 20 students in a kindergarten/ grade one class at an elementary school within school district 68. Of the 20 students fourteen were female and six were male, and all 20 consented to participating in this study. This qualitative descriptive, single case study design included the following instruments: student self-assessments/reflections, teacher observations/field notes, teacher check-ins, and a teacher interview. Verbal, physical and written/drawn data were coded for expressions of both positive and negative emotions.},

One of the initiatives within the CAP focused on the control of methane emissions, a potent short-lived climate pollutant. It called for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, the Interior, Labor, and Transportation to develop a comprehensive interagency “Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions.” The Strategy, released on March 28, 2014, committed to steps to cut methane emissions by an estimated 16\% from 2012 levels by 2020 through both voluntary actions and agency rulemaking. It also outlined the Administration’s efforts to improve the measurement and assessment of these emissions.},

Although marketplace lending is small compared with traditional lending, it has grown quickly in recent years. In general, marketplace lenders accept applications for small, unsecured loans online and determine applicants’ creditworthiness using an automated algorithm. Often, the loans are then sold—whole or in pieces—to investors. More traditional lenders are more apt to use employees to make credit assessments and have a greater need for office and retail space. Traditional lenders may hold loans themselves or package many loans together into large securities (a process called securitization). Due to these differences and to marketplace lending’s lack of industry track record, marketplace lending is facing uncertainty about its advantages, its risks, and how it should be treated by regulators.},

Military retirees are also entitled to nonmonetary benefits including exchange and commissary privileges, medical care through TRICARE, and access to Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) facilities and programs.},

The term is most often applied to wines, spirits, and agricultural products. Some food producers benefit from the use of GIs by giving certain foods recognition for their distinctiveness, differentiating them from other foods in the marketplace. In this manner, GIs can be commercially valuable. GIs may be eligible for relief from acts of infringement or unfair competition. GIs may also protect consumers from deceptive or misleading labels. Examples of GIs include Parmesan cheese and Parma ham from the Parma region of Italy, Tuscan olive oil, Roquefort cheese, Champagne from the region of the same name in France, Irish whiskey, Darjeeling tea, Ceylon tea, Florida Oranges, Idaho Potatoes, Vidalia Onions, Washington State Apples, and Napa Valley Wines.},

It is perennially controversial because the protections provided can make it the visible policy focal point for underlying situations involving the allocation of scarce or diminishing lands or resources, especially in instances where societal values may be changing. In response to past controversies, Congress has repeatedly considered minor amendments and major changes to the act.

  pages = {12},
  abstract = {More than two dozen legislative proposals in the 114th Congress include provisions concerning water use efficiency, or water conservation, in nonagricultural sectors. These legislative proposals do not seek to set specific enforceable water use efficiency standards or goals. Rather, most seek to encourage or provide incentives for adoption of practices, technologies, and measures to achieve improved water use efficiency. The 114th Congress legislation can be broadly grouped in five categories of proposals.  Codifying the WaterSense program. WaterSense is a voluntary labeling and recognition program that seeks to help consumers and businesses identify highly water-efficient products, services, and homes. It was established administratively by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2006. Nine legislative measures include provisions to establish the program in law.  Research and development. Several bills focus on research and development aspects of water use efficiency, including proposals that address needs for more and better water use data. Research also is examining technology advances in water and wastewater treatment facilities that would achieve water and energy savings.  Water use efficiency in buildings. Buildings are estimated to account for about 13\% of total water consumed in the United States; one-quarter of that total is used by commercial buildings, and three-quarters by residences. It is sometimes argued that, on matters of policy, the federal government should lead by example. Thus, several bills in the 114th Congress address aspects of water use efficiency in federal buildings.  Financial and technical assistance. The largest number of bills in the 114th Congress would provide technical and financial assistance for identifying, adopting, or demonstrating practices or measures that conserve water. A number of the bills would assist owners and operators of public water systems and water utilities in adopting or installing water-efficient systems, while a few would help provide incentives for consumers to purchase and install water-efficient products or services.},

  abstract = {A revolution in educaticn will require unusually competent, skilled, visionary leadership. This report examines the quality of educational leadership in the United States, focusing on the roles of principals and superintendents. According to recent research, the educational administration field lacks: (1) a definition of good educational leadership; (2) leadership recruitment programs in the schools; (3) collaboration between school districts and universities; (4) minority and women administrators; (5) systematic professional development for administrators; (6) high quality candidates and preparation programs relevant to job demands; (7) licensure programs promoting excellence; (8) national cooperation in preparing school leaders; and (9) sequence, modern content, and clinical experiences in preparation programs. The report aims to restructure school administration. Separate chapters outline recommendations for public schools, professional organizations, universities, state and federal policy makers, and the private sector. Significant recommendations include: (1) redefining educational leadership; (2) establishing a National Policy Board on Educational Administration; (3) modeling administration preparation programs after those of other professional schools; (4) terminating at least 300 college and university educational administration programs; (5) initiating recruitment and placement programs for minorities and women; (6) requiring public schools' full partnership in preparing administrators; (7) creating management development opportunities; and (8) reforming licensure programs. Included are numerous references and a list of commissioned papers.},

But in the big picture, roughly 60 percent of achievement outcomes is explained by student and family background characteristics (most are unobserved, but likely pertain to income/poverty). Observable and unobservable schooling factors explain roughly 20 percent, most of this (10-15 percent) being teacher effects. The rest of the variation (about 20 percent) is unexplained (error). In other words, though precise estimates vary, the preponderance of evidence shows that achievement differences between students are overwhelmingly attributable to factors outside of schools and classrooms (see \href{http://www.cgp.upenn.edu/pdf/Hanushek_NBER.PDF}{Hanushek et al. 1998}; \href{http://128.118.178.162/eps/pe/papers/0304/0304002.pdf}{Rockoff 2003}; \href{http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content%7Edb=all%7Econtent=a739140531}{Goldhaber et al. 1999}; \href{http://www.americancivil.literacy.org/sites/default/files/researchreport/791_rr51.pdf}{Rowan et al. 2002}; \href{http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/uploads/002/834/127%20-%20Nye%20B%20%20Hedges%20L%20%20V%20%20%20Konstantopoulos%20S%20%20%282004%29.pdf}{Nye et al. 2004}).~
