%     \item For conduit bonds, the California Department of Education or Department of Finance web sites 
%   \end{enumerate}

% Forms which have been filed with a government entity:

%   \item Annual and interim budgets submitted to the California Department of Education.
%   \item Petition approvals and renewals submitted to local school districts, the SCCOE, or the California State Board of Education.

%   The Santa Clara County Office of Education (SCCOE), and each school district in which Rocketship petitioned to open a school has some data/notes from one or more board meetings in which the petition or renewal was discussed. These data might have been presented by Rocketship or by county or district staff. Sometimes there is also public comment.
  
% Often, petitions presented to a school district have been denied and appealed to the Santa Clara County Board of Education, and in a few cases, to California's State Board of Education.

% Since a goal of this dissertation is to map the flow of money into and out of Rocketship, I will use diagrams similar to the one used by \citeauthor{Baker.Miron2015} (\citeyear{Baker.Miron2015}), which is reproduced here as \prettyref{fig:opresflows}.

% \subsection{Triangulation}\label{sec:findings-triangulation}\indent

% These data represent the monies that are flowing into Rocketship/Launchpad related to facilities, real estate, bonds, loans, and donations and not tied to the number of students. Once that's been assembled, roll up into one spreadsheet, Rocketship's consolidated financial statements for the fourteen years (2008--2022). The consolidated financial statements can then be compared against the known real estate, bond, loan, and donation transactions. Noe where data is missing or where it conflicts with the consolidated financial statements.

% In this example, money flows from left to right, and there are no loops. Colors are used merely to distinguish the various blocks.
